# Board Contract Year 2026 Child Care Provider Payment Rates - Q&A

## Questions and Answers

**Q1: When do the Board Contract Year 2026 child care provider payment rates become effective?**

A1: The Board Contract Year 2026 child care provider payment rates become effective on October 1, 2025. These rates are outlined in WD Letter 08-25 and apply to all Texas workforce development boards for reimbursing child care providers.

**Q2: What are the different types of child care providers recognized in the payment rate structure?**

A2: The payment rate structure recognizes five types of child care providers: Licensed Child Care Centers (LCCC), Licensed Child Care Homes (LCCH), Registered Child Care Homes (RCCH), and Relative providers. Additionally, providers can have quality ratings including Texas Rising Star (TRS) levels 2-4, Texas School Ready (TSR), or Regular (Reg) status, each with different payment rates.

**Q3: How do Texas Rising Star (TRS) ratings affect provider payment rates?**

A3: Texas Rising Star ratings significantly increase provider payment rates compared to regular (non-rated) providers. TRS2 providers receive approximately 5% more, TRS3 providers receive approximately 8% more, and TRS4 providers receive approximately 10% more than regular providers. For example, in Alamo-20, a regular LCCC receives $46.00 for infants (0-11 months FT), while TRS4 receives $50.29 for the same age group.

**Q4: What is the difference between Full Time (FT), Part Time (PT), and Blended Time (BT) care rates?**

A4: Full Time (FT) rates are the highest and apply to children receiving full-day care. Part Time (PT) rates are lower and apply to children receiving part-day care. Blended Time (BT) rates only apply to children ages 4-13 years and represent a rate for children who receive a combination of care schedules, typically falling between FT and PT rates.

**Q5: How do payment rates vary by child age groups?**

A5: Payment rates decrease as children get older, reflecting different care requirements. Infants (0-11 months) receive the highest rates, followed by toddlers (12-17 months and 18-23 months), two-year-olds, three-year-olds, and school-age children. For instance, in Capital Area-14, regular LCCC rates drop from $62.40 FT for infants to $52.60 FT for 6-13 year-olds.

**Q6: What are the payment rates for relative care providers compared to licensed facilities?**

A6: Relative care providers receive significantly lower payment rates than licensed facilities, typically 30-50% less than Licensed Child Care Centers. Relative providers do not have quality rating tiers like TRS or TSR. For example, in Greater Dallas-6, relatives receive $15.00 FT for infants, while regular LCCC receives $50.80 FT for the same age group.

**Q7: Which Texas workforce development board area has the highest child care provider payment rates?**

A7: The Capital Area-14 (Austin region) has among the highest payment rates. For example, their regular LCCC rate for infants (0-11 months) full-time is $62.40, and their TRS4 rate is $68.20. Gulf Coast-28 (Houston region) also has high rates at $47.00 regular and $51.40 TRS4 for infant care.

**Q8: How do Licensed Child Care Homes (LCCH) rates compare to Licensed Child Care Centers (LCCC)?**

A8: Licensed Child Care Homes typically receive slightly lower rates than Licensed Child Care Centers, usually about 5-15% less depending on the board area and age group. However, both provider types are eligible for the same Texas Rising Star quality rating increases. For example, in Alamo-20, regular LCCC receives $46.00 for infant FT care while regular LCCH receives $44.00.

**Q9: What payment rate applies to a 4-year-old child attending a TRS3-rated Licensed Child Care Center in Tarrant County for full-time care?**

A9: According to the Tarrant County-5 rates, a 4-year-old child attending a TRS3-rated Licensed Child Care Center for full-time care would be reimbursed at $48.86 per day. If the child attended part-time, the rate would be $42.22.

**Q10: Are there different payment rates for different workforce development board areas in Texas, and why might this variation exist?**

A10: Yes, payment rates vary significantly across Texas's 28 workforce development board areas, reflecting regional differences in cost of living, market rates for child care, and local economic conditions. For example, infant full-time care at a regular LCCC ranges from $31.80 in Northeast Texas-7 to $62.40 in Capital Area-14, nearly a 100% difference. This variation ensures rates are aligned with actual child care costs in each region.
