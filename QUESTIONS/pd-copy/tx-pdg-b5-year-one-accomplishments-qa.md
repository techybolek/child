# Texas PDG B-5 Year One Accomplishments - Question & Answer Pairs

## Q&A Pairs

**Q1: What is the PDG B-5 grant and which agencies oversee it?**

A1: The Preschool Development Grant Birth Through Five (PDG B-5) is overseen by the Early Childhood Interagency Workgroup, which consists of four Texas agencies: the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), the Texas Education Agency (TEA), the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS), and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). The TWC serves as the lead fiscal agent for the grant.

**Q2: How can communities use Early Childhood Systems Building (ECSB) subgrant funding?**

A2: Communities that receive ECSB subgrants can use the funding in three ways: to join the Help Me Grow network, to implement local systems-building components, or to enhance family engagement initiatives. These funds are specifically designed to advance local systems building and family engagement efforts across Texas.

**Q3: What accomplishments were made in building local early childhood systems during year one?**

A3: Year one achieved several significant milestones in local systems building: implementing four new Help Me Grow Texas affiliates, coordinating early childhood coalitions in 10 communities, establishing and enhancing centralized access navigation to family support services (including central intake and referral systems) in seven communities, and conducting child health care provider outreach and education in six communities.

**Q4: What initiatives were launched to connect families to services and engage them as leaders?**

A4: Multiple family-focused initiatives were launched, including creating six new family resource centers and expanding four existing centers, developing and supporting parent advisory committees in eight communities, implementing Parent Cafés in five communities to bring parents and caregivers together to strengthen families and build protective factors, and conducting family and community outreach and education in 13 communities.

**Q5: What is the Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation (IECMHC) project, and what are its expected outcomes?**

A5: The IECMHC project is funded by the PDG B-5 grant to increase access to high-quality programs. It is finalizing two important reports expected in January 2024: a landscape analysis of the current state of IECMHC in Texas and the country, and a report on best practices for implementing IECMHC programs. These reports will help develop a statewide IECMHC model and launch a pilot program in the project's second year.

**Q6: What is the Family Leadership Committee and what training did they receive?**

A6: The Family Leadership Committee was created by the Early Childhood Interagency Workgroup and includes representatives from each member agency. Committee members attended the National Family Support Network (NFSN) Standards of Quality for Family Strengthening and Support training, which helped inform the state-level approach to family engagement.

**Q7: How does the grant support children with disabilities or developmental delays?**

A7: The grant provides funding for assessments and early interventions for young children with disabilities or developmental delays. This support aims to increase school readiness and reduce the need for expensive interventions later, making early identification and intervention a priority.

**Q8: What workforce development initiatives were completed in year one?**

A8: A comprehensive landscape analysis was completed for counties with early learning career and technical education (CTE) programs of study, institutes of higher education (IHEs) offering early childhood degrees and certificates, and early childhood Registered Apprenticeship programs. Additionally, a request for applications (RFA) is being developed to expand scholarships covering the cost of the Childhood Development Associate (CDA) exam, and an "Earning a CDA Through CTE" guidance document was made available for administrators at local educational agencies.

**Q9: What is the Texas Early Childhood Integrated Data System Roadmap and its purpose?**

A9: The Texas Early Childhood Integrated Data System Roadmap is a newly available document that outlines ongoing data projects for young children and their families in Texas. The roadmap will support the development of an Early Childhood Integrated Data System during the project's second and third years, helping to build a comprehensive, integrated statewide data system.

**Q10: What are the four phases of the Early Childhood System Needs Assessment?**

A10: The Early Childhood System Needs Assessment consists of four phases: Workforce (evaluating early childhood workers' conditions and needs through surveys and interviews), Local coalitions (measuring early childhood coalitions' development, engagement, collaboration, and network quality through surveys), Families (surveying families with young children about their opinions on early childhood services), and Data systems (synthesizing state and local integration efforts). This comprehensive assessment will provide crucial insights into system needs and gaps.
