# Question-Answer Pairs: Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Subsidized Child Care Program - 88th Texas Legislature

## Report Overview and Purpose

**Q1: What is the primary purpose of the Texas Workforce Commission's subsidized child care program?**

A1: TWC provides subsidized child care as a support service to help parents become and remain employed and contribute to the Texas economy. To receive subsidized child care, parents must be employed or participating in training or education activities that lead to employment. The program addresses a common barrier to employment and enhances parents' ability to participate in workforce training activities.

**Q2: What are the reporting requirements for TWC regarding child care program effectiveness?**

A2: Texas Labor Code §302.0043 requires TWC to evaluate the effectiveness of the child care program in helping parents maintain employment and report results to the legislature no later than January 15 of each odd-numbered year. The reports must include employment and wage outcomes for TANF and non-TANF parents, information disaggregated by local workforce development area, and multiyear trends covering the five state fiscal years preceding the report date.

**Q3: How is the subsidized child care program funded and which state agencies are involved?**

A3: Child Care Services are funded through the federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), overseen by the US Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Child Care. TWC is the lead agency for CCDF in Texas. Additional agencies involved include: HHSC (protects health and safety by regulating providers), TEA and CLI (coordinate early childhood education and pre-K services), and DFPS (provides CCS to children in foster care or CPS custody).

## Employment and Wage Outcomes

**Q4: What were the employment outcomes for TANF parents receiving child care in 2020?**

A4: In 2020, approximately 76 percent of parents receiving TANF found employment within 12 months of receiving child care. Additionally, approximately 55.24 percent of TANF parents maintained employment after one year. These figures represent a decrease from previous years, with 2018 showing 86.06% finding employment and 65.23% maintaining employment.

**Q5: How did non-TANF parents perform in terms of employment retention and wage gains?**

A5: In 2020, approximately 80.80 percent of non-TANF parents maintained employment 12 months after receiving child care. At the end of the 12-month period, they experienced an average quarterly wage gain of $1,930 ($7,720 annually). This represents the highest wage gain in the five-year trend period, showing significant income improvement for working families.

**Q6: What were the main reasons parents left the child care program between October 2021 and September 2022?**

A6: From October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, a total of 42,839 children left TWC-subsidized child care for at least one month. The reasons were: 43.16% - parent missed redetermination and/or did not return paperwork; 23.87% - parent voluntarily withdrew from child care; 25.09% - family is no longer eligible; 5.95% - permanent end of activities after three-month job search; 0.87% - excessive absences; and 2.06% - other reasons.

## Texas Rising Star Program

**Q7: What is the Texas Rising Star program and how has it grown?**

A7: Texas Rising Star is a quality-based rating system for Texas early childhood programs participating in TWC's subsidized child care program. It offers three levels of certification (Two-Star, Three-Star, and Four-Star) to encourage programs to attain progressively higher certification requirements. Since 2015, the number of Texas Rising Star-certified programs has increased 56 percent. As of September 2022, 2,008 programs participated in Texas Rising Star, representing approximately 31% of all programs with agreements to accept subsidized children.

**Q8: What is the capacity impact of Texas Rising Star programs?**

A8: As of September 2022, Texas Rising Star programs had the licensed capacity to serve 232,224 children. These programs benefit both children receiving subsidies and children from private-pay families. The programs serve approximately 53.3% of all subsidized children (69,601 out of 130,684 total subsidized children), demonstrating the significant reach of quality-rated care.

**Q9: What were the key changes implemented through HB 2607?**

A9: HB 2607, 87th Texas Legislature, Regular Session (2021), amended Texas Government Code §2308.3155 to require that all regulated providers of TWC-funded Child Care Services participate in the Texas Rising Star program. It also required creation of a new Entry Level designation and a maximum length of time (24 months) that a child care program may participate at the Entry Level. Effective October 3, 2022, TWC implemented Entry Level designation for 4,476 CCS providers that were not currently Texas Rising Star-certified.

## Quality Improvement Initiatives

**Q10: What are Pre-K partnerships and how much funding did TWC allocate for their expansion?**

A10: Pre-K partnerships are collaborations between a local education agency (LEA), such as a school district or open enrollment charter school, and a quality-rated child care program to provide high-quality care and education to eligible three- and four-year-old children. In November 2021, TWC's Commission approved $26 million in COVID-19 CCDBG funding to support pre-K partnership expansion. TWC provides eligible programs awards of up to $20,000 per new partnership classroom and up to $7,000 scholarships for up to 100 teachers to obtain alternative teacher certification. An additional $2.4 million was approved for the TAMUS Intermediary Hub model.

**Q11: How does TWC support professional development for early childhood educators?**

A11: TWC supports professional development through multiple initiatives: (1) $1.5 million over the 2022-2023 biennium for scholarships through the TXAEYC T.E.A.C.H. program for CDA certificates, degrees, and apprenticeships; (2) $500,000 transferred to TEA for ECE partnership projects and teacher stipends; (3) $11.7 million transferred to TEA annually for the Texas School Ready project; (4) Annual Texas Rising Star Early Educator Conferences (714 attendees in 2022); (5) Child Care Business Accelerator program with over 4,900 participants as of September 2022.

**Q12: What is the Infant-Toddler Specialist Network and what does it provide?**

A12: In March 2020, TWC awarded $3 million to the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston to establish the statewide Infant-Toddler Specialist Network (ITSN). The network provides teachers and administrators of 1,842 infant and toddler programs with professional development, technical support, and opportunities to participate in professional learning communities through 64 certified specialists. This helps enhance the quality of care provided to infants and toddlers across the state and elevate the skills and competencies of participating teachers and administrators.

## COVID-19 Response and Relief

**Q13: What were the Child Care Relief Funds (CCRF) and how much was distributed?**

A13: TWC issued two rounds of CCRF to child care providers that were open and operating, available to all state-regulated providers regardless of subsidy program participation. In 2021, TWC awarded 9,479 providers more than $582 million of CRRSA funding (averaging $84,000 for licensed centers, $6,900 for licensed home-based providers, and $6,500 for registered home-based providers). In 2022, TWC awarded 10,809 providers nearly $3 billion of ARPA Stabilization Grant and CRRSA funds (averaging $371,800 for licensed centers, $31,400 for licensed home-based providers, and $28,700 for registered home-based providers).

**Q14: What is the Child Care Provider Expansion Initiative and what are its goals?**

A14: In 2022, the Commission approved $150 million in CRRSA and ARPA funding to increase the number of high-quality home- and center-based child care providers. The initiative includes: funding for CCR navigators to support new providers through licensing; funding to Boards for business outreach staffing; and start-up funding (CCPEI) for programs in child care deserts, programs partnering with local employers, and state infant care. As of November 2022, 125 applications were approved for more than $7 million, proposing to open 6,136 new child care spaces, including 3,191 for infant care.

**Q15: What are Shared Services Alliance Hubs and how are they being implemented?**

A15: In June and July 2022, TWC awarded four grants totaling approximately $5.7 million to plan and implement Shared Services Alliances. The grantees (AVANCE, Inc.; Collaborative for Children; Pre-K 4 SA; and TXAEYC) have approximately six months to plan their alliance and 18 months to implement it. Each grantee provides different services to various provider populations and regions, including accounting support, marketing support, staff recruitment and retention support, digital literacy support, health benefits, and substitute pools. An additional $400,000 was awarded to OppEx (partnered with Children at Risk) to provide ongoing guidance and support.

## Local Workforce Development Boards

**Q16: How do Local Workforce Development Boards leverage local match funding?**

A16: Boards leverage local public expenditures to draw down federal CCDF matching funds by working with public institutions of higher education, independent school districts, and local governments. In BCY'21, Boards entered into 141 agreements for approximately $46.1 million in local match, drawing down $82.7 million in federal CCDF. In BCY'22, they entered into 142 agreements for approximately $43.8 million in local match, drawing down $82.7 million in federal CCDF. The resulting funds are used to increase direct child care services to CCDF-eligible families and expand quality improvement activities.

**Q17: What quality improvement activities are Local Workforce Development Boards required to fund?**

A17: Texas Government Code §2308.317(c) requires each Board to use at least 2 percent of its yearly child care allocation for quality initiatives, giving priority to initiatives benefiting facilities working toward Texas Rising Star certification or working toward higher certification levels. In FY'22, Boards expended approximately $5.6 million on professional development activities, including training for 31,177 participants, 1,292 locally funded scholarships for CDA classes and college degrees, and financial assistance for 540 individuals to complete other professional development activities.

## Coordination and Collaboration

**Q18: How does TWC coordinate with TEA to assign PEIMS numbers to children in subsidized care?**

A18: Texas Labor Code §302.0043 requires TWC to coordinate with TEA to assign unique PEIMS numbers to children younger than age six enrolled in the child care subsidy program, allowing for longitudinal analysis bridging early childhood programs to public education. TWC collaborated with TEA to develop an automated interface and began assigning PEIMS numbers to children under age six on September 1, 2020. As of November 2022, a total of 217,539 children participating in the CCS program have a PEIMS number in both TWC and TEA data systems.
