# Texas Rising Star Stakeholder Input - Questions & Answers

## Q1: How often is TWC required to review the Texas Rising Star program?
**A1:** TWC is required to review the Texas Rising Star program every four years. The most recent review involved the 2023 Texas Rising Star Four-Year Review Workgroup, which met over a 6-month period and included child care program directors, Local Workforce Boards, child care organizations, and other state agencies.

## Q2: What is Entry Level Designation (ELD) and how is it calculated?
**A2:** Entry Level Designation (ELD) is a status based on a provider's Child Care Regulation (CCR) compliance history. It's calculated using high-weighted deficiencies (scored at 5 points each) and medium-high deficiencies (scored at 3 points each). Providers are eligible for ELD if they do not exceed a 75-point threshold when these deficiencies are totaled.

## Q3: What changes were recommended for the Initial Certification Screening Form for new Texas Rising Star providers?
**A3:** The Workgroup recommended two major changes: First, reducing the number of specific CCR standards that providers must not have been cited for from 12 to 4 standards in the past 12 months. Second, lowering the points threshold from 75 to 50 points total when calculating high- and medium-high-deficiencies. These changes create more consistency and alignment with the Entry Level Designation process.

## Q4: What is Probation B status and when are providers placed on it under the revised recommendations?
**A4:** Probation B is a status for current Texas Rising Star certified providers who have compliance issues. Under the revised Certified Screening Form recommendations, providers that incur 51-75 points total when calculating high- and medium-high-deficiencies will be placed on Probation B. This aligns with the revised Initial Screening Form thresholds and creates more consistency across the program.

## Q5: What happens to Texas Rising Star providers who exceed 75 points in deficiencies?
**A5:** Providers who exceed 75 points when calculating high- and medium-high-deficiencies will be placed on suspension status. This threshold applies to both the revised Initial Screening Form (where providers would not be eligible for certification) and the Certified Screening Form (where current certified providers would lose their active certification status).

## Q6: How will the process for reviewing CCR deficiencies change under the recommended revisions?
**A6:** The Workgroup recommended implementing a real-time, automated process instead of the current quarterly review. This new system would notify assessors immediately when a provider incurs a CCR deficiency, allowing for timelier implementation of impacts. Assessors will still review the deficiencies and determine potential Texas Rising Star impacts based on the applicable Screening Form.

## Q7: What is the current policy regarding facility changes for Texas Rising Star certified providers?
**A7:** Currently, Texas Rising Star requires programs to maintain a full permit from CCR throughout their certification. When certified providers undergo facility changes that result in CCR issuing an initial permit (rather than a full permit), their certification status is immediately suspended until they regain their full permit.

## Q8: How would the recommended revisions change the facility change process for certified providers?
**A8:** The Workgroup recommended allowing certified programs to retain their Texas Rising Star certification for up to six months following a facility change. Under this new process, programs must be reassessed within three months of the change and must obtain a full permit within six months of the change to continue retaining their certification, rather than facing immediate suspension.

## Q9: What new CCR standard was recommended to be added to the Certified Screening Form?
**A9:** The Workgroup recommended adding a new CCR standard specific to Child/Caregiver ratios to the Certified Screening Form. This addition would make ratio compliance a specific factor in determining whether current Texas Rising Star providers maintain their certification status.

## Q10: How can stakeholders provide feedback about the Texas Rising Star program and the proposed revisions?
**A10:** Stakeholders can provide additional feedback about the Texas Rising Star program and the proposed revisions by emailing TWC at TRS4YearReview@twc.texas.gov. This allows community members, providers, and other interested parties to contribute input on the recommended changes before they are finalized.
