# PDG B-5 Year Two Accomplishments - Q&A

## Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is the Preschool Development Grant Birth Through Five (PDG B-5) program?**

A1: The Preschool Development Grant Birth Through Five (PDG B-5) is a program managed by the Texas Workforce Commission that focuses on improving early childhood education systems in Texas. The program works on multiple strategic areas including connecting families to services, supporting local systems building, expanding access to high-quality programs, strengthening the early childhood care and education (ECCE) workforce, and developing integrated data systems for children from birth through age five.

**Q2: What is the Early Childhood Texas website and what key feature will it include?**

A2: The Early Childhood Texas website is a new platform scheduled to launch in summer that will serve as a central resource for early childhood services. Its key feature will be an eligibility screener, currently in final stages of approval, developed in partnership with a vendor. This screener will help families determine their eligibility for child care scholarships, public school pre-K, and Head Start/Early Head Start programs, making it easier for families to access available early childhood education services.

**Q3: How is the Help Me Grow (HMG) initiative supporting local early childhood systems in Texas?**

A3: The Help Me Grow entity has collaborated to design funding opportunities that advance local early childhood systems through several mechanisms. Grantees are implementing four new HMG affiliates, coordinating early childhood coalitions in 10 communities, and establishing or enhancing centralized access navigation with a central intake and referral system in seven communities. Family navigators provide centralized resource navigation to connect families to needed services, improving coordination and ensuring better access to resources.

**Q4: What is the purpose of the CCR navigator positions funded by PDG B-5?**

A4: PDG B-5 funding supports eight full-time CCR (Child Care Regulation) navigator positions that specifically focus on child care deserts and rural areas. These positions aim to decrease permitting timelines for new child care operations, increase the number of providers in high-need areas, ensure program sustainability, and improve access to resources for new child care operations, ultimately expanding access to quality child care in underserved communities.

**Q5: What is the Early Educator Credit Pathways Support funding opportunity?**

A5: The Early Educator Credit Pathways Support funding opportunity is designed to develop robust educational pathways for early educators, starting in high school and continuing through various options like CDA credential attainment or enrollment in public Texas Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs). The model supports credit for prior learning between educational programs, specifically from CDA to associate or bachelor's degrees, and from associate to bachelor's degrees. TWC offers funding to Public IHEs and their public educational partners for personnel and indirect costs to develop these pathways and build a pipeline of qualified early childhood professionals.

**Q6: What progress has been made on the Early Childhood Integrated Data System (ECIDS)?**

A6: The Texas Education Agency (TEA) team is advancing ECIDS development by hiring two new specialized roles. These include an ECIDS Product Manager as a new full-time position in the Early Childhood Education division and an ECIDS Business Analyst hired as a contractor in the IT department. These positions will focus specifically on developing and implementing the statewide integrated data system for early childhood.

**Q7: What is the Texas Early Learning Council (TELC) Strategic Plan Workgroup and what does it do?**

A7: The TELC Strategic Plan Workgroup is a collaborative body that held its inaugural meeting in early December 2024. The group comprises six members from the TELC and four appointed individuals. Its primary objective is to address and advance the Goals and Action Items from the Strategic Plan that are specifically assigned to the TELC, helping to coordinate and implement strategic early childhood education initiatives across Texas.

**Q8: How does centralized resource navigation benefit families seeking early childhood services?**

A8: Centralized resource navigation, facilitated by family navigators, connects families to needed services while improving coordination and ensuring better resource access. This system provides families with a single point of contact through a central intake and referral system, making it easier to navigate the complex landscape of early childhood services and ensuring families don't miss out on programs and supports they're eligible for.

**Q9: What early childhood programs are included in the eligibility screening tool being developed?**

A9: The eligibility screening tool being developed for the Early Childhood Texas website will include criteria for three major early childhood education programs: child care scholarships (subsidies), public school pre-K programs, and Head Start/Early Head Start programs. This comprehensive screener will help families quickly determine which programs they qualify for in one centralized location.

**Q10: What resources and websites are available for learning more about PDG B-5 initiatives in Texas?**

A10: Several websites provide information about PDG B-5 initiatives including the main PDG B-5 Site, Early Childhood Texas, Help Me Grow Texas, Early Childhood Mental Health, Early Educators Credit Pathways, the Statewide Needs Assessment, and the Statewide Strategic Plan. For direct contact, stakeholders can email PDGTX@twc.texas.gov. These resources offer comprehensive information about early childhood programs, funding opportunities, workforce development, and strategic planning efforts in Texas.
