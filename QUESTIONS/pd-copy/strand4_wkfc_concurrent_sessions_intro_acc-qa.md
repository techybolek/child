## Based on: Strand 4 Workforce Concurrent Sessions Introduction (December 9, 2020)

---

Q1: What are the three Early Childhood Educator (ECE) designations established by NAEYC's Power to the Profession framework?
A1: The three designations are: ECE I, which requires completion of a professional preparation program meeting a minimum of 120 clock hours; ECE II, which requires completion of an early childhood education associate degree program; and ECE III, which requires completion of an early childhood education bachelor's degree program or master's degree program. These designations create a unified framework for professional qualifications in the early childhood education field.

Q2: What are the four main pillars of the Alliance for Early Success's policy roadmap for transforming child care systems?
A2: The four main pillars are: (1) Increase Access and Affordability for All Families, (2) Advance the Early Care and Education Profession, (3) Reform Child Care Financing, and (4) Build a Better Child Care Business Model. This roadmap provides a comprehensive approach to addressing systemic issues in the nation's child care system.

Q3: What are the key recommendations for advancing the early care and education profession according to the Alliance for Early Success?
A3: The key recommendations include: securing public investment specifically for educators' compensation and benefits; building educators' power through a unified voice; establishing policies tailored to support home-based providers' practice; and investing in educators' career and educational advancement, especially for educators of color and multilingual educators. These strategies aim to professionalize and strengthen the early childhood workforce.

Q4: What compensation strategies are recommended to improve early childhood educator pay?
A4: Recommended strategies include: developing a salary scale for early childhood educators and program directors (including benefits) that is aligned with the professional designations in the state's career ladder; providing bonus pay and health care benefits to child care staff as part of COVID-19 response; implementing temporary bridge programs such as wage supplements and tax credits to provide supplemental income supports; and using contracts coupled with increased funding to support meeting higher compensation standards, such as parity with K-12 teachers and salary scales.

Q5: According to the Child Care Services Association's 2020 data, what is the primary reason early childhood educators leave the classroom?
A5: The primary reason educators leave the classroom is to make more money, cited by 41% of respondents. This is followed by professional growth opportunities (32%), better benefits (25%), and better working conditions (20%). This data highlights that compensation is the most significant factor driving turnover in the early childhood education workforce.

Q6: What are the six concurrent session topics offered in Strand 4 of the workforce development program?
A6: The six concurrent session topics are: (1) Workforce Qualifications, Certificates and Credentials; (2) Access to Education and Training; (3) PD Career Pathways and Registries; (4) Recruitment, Retention and Turnover; (5) Targeted Coaching and Mentoring Systems; and (6) Compensation Strategies. These sessions provide focused discussions on critical workforce issues in early childhood education.

Q7: How has the approach to training and professional development evolved in early childhood education?
A7: The approach has evolved to include increased reliance on online learning, rethinking traditional topics in new ways (such as trauma-informed care, culturally responsive care, family partnerships, and business administration), and significant expansion of coaching and mentoring. Coaching now encompasses a variety of models and purposes, includes virtual coaching options, focuses on coaching competencies, and considers the appropriate dose, duration, and intensity of the coaching experience.

Q8: What are the core components of NAEYC's Unifying Framework for the Early Childhood Education Profession?
A8: The core components include: Career Pathways, Knowledge & Competencies, Qualifications, Standards, Accountability, and Supports & Compensation. This framework, part of the Power to the Profession initiative, aims to create a cohesive professional structure for early childhood educators and establish clear expectations and supports across the field.

Q9: Besides compensation, what other significant reasons do early childhood educators cite for leaving their positions?
A9: Beyond making more money, educators cite several other reasons: seeking professional growth opportunities (32%), obtaining better benefits (25%), improving working conditions (20%), receiving more respect (16%), getting support for challenging behaviors (12%), having more paid time off (12%), receiving a promotion (11%), and staying home with family (11%). These factors demonstrate that retention requires addressing multiple aspects of the work environment and professional support.

Q10: What organization provides the PDG B-5 TA Center services, and how is it funded?
A10: The PDG B-5 TA Center is operated by SRI International and is a service of the Office of Child Care. It is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Care, under Contract Number HHSP233201500041I.
