# Provider Attendance Matrix - Question & Answer Pairs

## Q1: How do new sponsors or parents register for the KinderConnect system?
**A1:** New sponsors or parents can register for a new account by visiting https://childcare.twc.texas.gov/KinderConnect. If they encounter error messages during registration such as "Unable to Match/Unable to Uniquely Identify" or "Account Already Exists," they should contact support for assistance. Only the main parent/sponsor can use KinderConnect.

## Q2: What should I do if I receive an "Access Denied" error message when trying to use KinderConnect?
**A2:** The "Access Denied" error message typically means that you are not the main parent/sponsor for the account. Only the main parent/sponsor can use KinderConnect. If you believe you should have access, contact KinderConnect support at 1-888-265-6461 or email supportTX@kindersystems.com.

## Q3: How do parents or sponsors sign in for attendance using KinderSign?
**A3:** Parents or sponsors sign in on the child care provider's tablet using KinderSign by entering their phone number and their 4-digit PIN. If the tablet is offline, they can still sign kids in and out, and the system will update automatically when the tablet reconnects to the internet.

## Q4: Can attendance be changed after it has been recorded in the system?
**A4:** No, once a parent or sponsor has recorded attendance, it cannot be changed. This is a permanent record in the system. If corrections are needed, only parents/sponsors are authorized to make corrections to attendance errors through KinderConnect, but they cannot modify already-entered attendance.

## Q5: How far back can parents or sponsors backdate attendance records?
**A5:** Parents or sponsors can only record attendance up to 6 days in the past. Beyond this timeframe, backdating is not possible. They use KinderConnect to backdate attendance by signing in with their phone number and 4-digit PIN on the child care provider's tablet.

## Q6: What should I do if KinderConnect shows that attendance is wrong or missing times?
**A6:** Don't worry if KinderConnect indicates attendance is wrong. You only need one "in" OR one "out" time per day. Simply enter the missing time to complete the record. If you're having trouble finding the right entry, click "all" at the top of the page to view all attendance records.

## Q7: Do child care providers need to enter closure days, professional development days, or holidays into the system?
**A7:** No, currently providers do not need to enter any closure days, professional development days, or holidays into the system. There is no action required from providers for these types of days.

## Q8: What are the differences between KinderConnect, KinderSign, and KinderSmart?
**A8:** KinderConnect is the website where parents/sponsors can see attendance records, update contact information, view subsidy documents, and download the KinderSmart registration form. KinderSign is the app on the tablet (sometimes called TX3C) used for recording attendance. KinderSmart is the app available on smartphones for mobile access.

## Q9: What should I do if attendance is missing in KinderConnect or has disappeared?
**A9:** If attendance is missing in KinderConnect, the tablet needs to upload the sign-in/out information first. If the data doesn't upload before the system automatically submits the attendance, the provider cannot submit it themselves. If attendance has disappeared, the provider cannot fix this or see the history and needs to ask their Board for help.

## Q10: What are the KinderConnect support hours and how can I contact them for help?
**A10:** KinderConnect Support is available Monday through Friday, 6 AM to 9 PM Central Time. You can reach them by calling 1-888-265-6461, emailing supportTX@kindersystems.com, or accessing online help at http://tx3c.info/. They can assist with registration issues, technical problems, and attendance questions.
