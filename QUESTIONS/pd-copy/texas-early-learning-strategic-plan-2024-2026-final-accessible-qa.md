# Texas Early Learning Strategic Plan 2024-2026 - Q&A

Q1: What is the vision of the Texas Early Learning Strategic Plan 2024-2026?
A1: The vision is that "All young Texans have a strong foundation for success." This vision focuses on ensuring children in Texas are physically, mentally, emotionally, and socially ready to transition to kindergarten and beyond by holistically supporting the adults, communities, and entities who serve young children. The plan emphasizes building this foundation through supportive parents/caregivers, accessible early learning services, a well-paid and trained workforce, strong local collaborations, and data-informed state coordination.

Q2: How many main goals does the strategic plan include and what are they?
A2: The plan includes four main goals organized into strategic areas: (1) Family Navigation, Access & Engagement - ensuring families can easily meet their basic needs and access early learning services while providing meaningful feedback; (2) Workforce Recruitment, Retention & Support - creating a well-paid, trained, and supported early learning workforce; (3) Local Systems & Partnership Building - developing well-coordinated local early learning systems; and (4) Data & System Coordination - promoting collaboration among state entities to make family- and data-informed decisions to improve services.

Q3: What is the Texas Early Learning System and which state entities are involved?
A3: The Texas Early Learning System provides services, programs, and resources across six state entities to serve over 1.8 million families with children under age five. The entities include: Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS), Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), Texas Education Agency (TEA), Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), and the Texas Head Start State Collaboration Office (THSSCO). The Early Childhood Interagency Workgroup (ECIW) and Texas Early Learning Council (TELC) coordinate efforts across these entities.

Q4: What are the three categories used to classify the plan's actions, and what do they mean?
A4: The plan categorizes actions into three types to indicate their current progress: (1) Continue - actions that refine, expand, or proceed with work already in progress; (2) Create - actions that require developing something new that has yet to be created; and (3) Explore - actions that are preliminary in nature or process-oriented that will lead to future strategies and actions. This classification helps stakeholders understand where each initiative stands in the implementation timeline.

Q5: How does the strategic plan address streamlining family access to early learning programs?
A5: The plan includes multiple strategies to streamline family access, including: launching a common eligibility screener on earlychildhood.texas.gov for TEA, THSSCO, and TWC programs; developing a mechanism to notify families of their eligibility for other services; exploring ways to reduce redundancy in program applications; expanding Help Me Grow Texas and Healthy Child Care Texas for cross-sector developmental screenings; and utilizing the Early Childhood Integrated Data System (ECIDS) to identify overlap and gaps among families served by early learning programs.

Q6: What workforce support initiatives are included in the plan to improve recruitment and retention?
A6: The plan addresses workforce support through several initiatives: continuing scholarships and Registered Apprenticeships to cover CDA, associates, and bachelor's credentials (750 scholarships in FFY 2024-2026); providing recruitment and retention stipends for 800 HHSC ECI therapists; offering child care business training about evidence-based staff retention strategies to 210 providers; expanding access to teacher-child interaction assessment and coaching models (100 teachers by 2026); creating peer-to-peer mentoring opportunities; and developing messaging that elevates the importance of early learning workers as vital to the Texas economy.

Q7: What is the Early Childhood Integrated Data System (ECIDS) and what are its goals?
A7: ECIDS is a data system being developed to strengthen data sharing across agencies and better inform state-level policy and program improvement. By the end of 2026, ECIDS aims to answer foundational questions around eligibility, access, and enrollment in early learning services and programs in Texas. The plan includes creating a cross-agency data governance plan, developing required data sharing agreements, designing a data dashboard for communities with usage instructions, and building business cases to identify overlap and gaps among families served by all early learning programs.

Q8: How will the strategic plan support local communities and partnerships?
A8: The plan supports local communities through several mechanisms: DFPS/HHSC will continue offering sub-grants to existing PEI local programs to hire full-time staff for coalition work and focus on community needs ($5.5 million across 29 communities); TWC and TEA will continue supporting pre-kindergarten and child care partnerships (300 partnerships by 2026); TELC will expand the Prevention and Early Intervention Community Toolkit to include best practices, guidance on public/private partnerships, funding strategies, governance and leadership resources; and a centralized list of community collaborations and coalitions will be created and published.

Q9: What role does family feedback play in the strategic plan, and how will it be collected?
A9: Family feedback is central to the plan's success. The plan emphasizes that when parents believe their child care providers are partners in their child's wellbeing, they rate their own family's quality of life and resiliency higher. Strategies include: LEAs creating and posting Prekindergarten Family Engagement Plans on district web pages; DFPS/HHSC partnering with local coalitions to collect family feedback; ECIW and TELC creating more opportunities for families to provide feedback on early learning system services; publishing family feedback and related service improvements through early learning communications channels; and conducting regular family engagement activities with results published on earlylearningtexas.org.

Q10: How will progress on the strategic plan be monitored and reported?
A10: Progress will be monitored through quarterly reviews at public TELC meetings throughout the plan timeline. A work plan and progress report template will be created in early 2024, with each action item assigned a lead state entity that provides quarterly updates and a progress indicator (Not Started, In Progress, Blocked, Complete). Plan progress reports will be published on the TELC website (earlylearningtexas.org) after every quarterly TELC meeting. The plan is subject to adjustments based on state infrastructure, governance, policies, standards, regulations, and statutes, with opportunities for public feedback through a website comment box and oral/written comments at all TELC meetings.
