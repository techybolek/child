### Q2: How does the PSoC change when families have multiple children in care?
**A2:** The PSoC includes an add-on percentage for each additional child beyond the first child. This add-on varies by income level - for example, at 15% SMI, there's a 0.225% add-on per additional child, while at 35% SMI it's 0.525%. Notably, at 85% SMI (the highest income bracket), there is no additional charge for extra children (0.000% add-on). At higher income levels (75% and 85% SMI), the add-on is significantly lower at 0.072% and 0.000% respectively.
