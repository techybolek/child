# KinderConnect Provider Payment Proof - Q&A

## Overview Questions

**Q1: What is the purpose of the KinderConnect Provider Payment Proof Desk Aid?**

A1: The desk aid helps Child Care Services providers use the Payments section of KinderConnect to access and verify their payment information. It provides step-by-step instructions for searching payment records, generating payment statements, and reconciling payment adjustments through the TX3C (Texas Child Care Connection) system.

**Q2: Where can providers find additional resources about TX3C (Texas Child Care Connection)?**

A2: Additional resources on TX3C (Texas Child Care Connection) are available at https://tx3c.info. This website provides supplementary information and support materials for using the KinderConnect system.

## Searching by Processed Date

**Q3: How do I access provider payment proofs by Processed Date in KinderConnect?**

A3: To access payment proofs by Processed Date: (1) Click "Payments" under the Provider tab in the KinderConnect portal, (2) Enter the Start Date and End Date when payments were processed (you can use the Calendar button), (3) Select "Processed Date" in the Date Filter field, (4) Select "Paid" in the Status field, and (5) Press the Search button.

**Q4: What does the "Processed Date" represent in the payment search?**

A4: The Processed Date is the date when the Local Workforce Board processed the payment. Searching by this date allows you to view all payments and/or adjustments that were processed for your center on a particular payment date, which is useful for reconciling payments you received on a specific date.

**Q5: What information appears in the Search Results when I search by Processed Date?**

A5: The Search Results will display all paid payments processed on the selected date, showing columns for Payment ID, Status (which will show "Paid"), and Status Date (which is the Processed Date). You can check the box next to specific payments you want to view and then press Print to generate a Payment Statement report.

## Searching by Service Period

**Q6: How is searching by Service Period different from searching by Processed Date?**

A6: Searching by Service Period includes all dates of service within a given service period, rather than focusing on when the payment was processed. This method is useful when you want to see all payments related to care provided during a specific timeframe, regardless of when those payments were actually processed by the Workforce Board.

**Q7: What steps do I follow to search for payments by Service Period?**

A7: To search by Service Period: (1) The Provider will be automatically selected, (2) Enter the Start Date and End Date of the service period or use the Calendar button, (3) Select "Service Period" in the Date Filter field, (4) Select "Paid" in the Status field, (5) Press the Search button, and (6) Check the boxes for payments you want to view and press Print.

**Q8: What additional information is displayed when searching by Service Period compared to Processed Date?**

A8: When searching by Service Period, the Search Results display additional columns including "Period Start Date" and "Period End Date" in addition to Payment ID, Status, and Status Date. This allows you to see exactly which service period each payment covers, making it easier to track payments for specific care delivery timeframes.

## Payment Statements and Reconciliation

**Q9: What should I do if the totals on my Payment Statement report don't match the payment I received?**

A9: If there are any discrepancies between the totals reflected on the Payment Statement report and the amount of payment you have received, you should contact your Local Workforce Board immediately. They can help investigate and resolve any payment inconsistencies.

**Q10: How can I view detailed information about a specific payment, including any adjustments that were made?**

A10: When viewing Search Results, you can select "Details" to view additional payment information. For payments with adjustments, you'll see both a "Details" option (showing the adjustment information and Original Payment details) and an "Original Payment" option (showing the payment details before the adjustment was made). The Payment Summary will display line items including Provider Amount, Reimbursable Amount, Calculated Amount, Sibling Reduction, Family Fee, Additional Family Fee, Provider Levy, and the final Payment Amount.

## Payment Details and Adjustments

**Q11: What information is included in the Payment Summary when I view payment Details?**

A11: The Payment Summary includes several key fields: Provider Amount (the base payment), Reimbursable Amount, Calculated Amount, Sibling Reduction (if applicable), Family Fee, Additional Family Fee, Provider Levy, and the final Payment Amount. This breakdown helps you understand how your payment was calculated and what deductions or fees were applied.

**Q12: How are payment adjustments displayed in KinderConnect, and how can I understand what changed?**

A12: Payment adjustments appear in the Search Results with the adjusted amount highlighted (positive or negative). Under the Details tab, you can view both the "Details" (showing the adjustment with Previous Provider Amount compared to new Provider Amount) and "Original Payment" (showing the original payment before adjustment). The Service Period dates help identify which timeframe the adjustment relates to, and all previous amounts are clearly labeled for comparison.

## Export and Documentation

**Q13: How do I generate and download a Payment Statement report?**

A13: After performing a search (either by Processed Date or Service Period), check the boxes next to the payment(s) you want to include in the report, then press the "Print" button. The Payment Statement report will automatically download to your computer with the paid payments you selected from the Search Results.

**Q14: What information is displayed on the downloaded Payment Statement report?**

A14: The Payment Statement report displays the statement date, provider information, and a detailed breakdown by family/child and age group. For each entry, it shows the Payment ID (Pmt ID), Period (service dates), Payment Type (such as ChildCare), and Amount. It also includes details like "TRS3 X BL Days@ XX.XX" showing Texas Rising Star billing details, Family Fee deductions, and a Provider Total at the bottom summing all payments.

**Q15: Can I export payment data for multiple service periods or payment dates at once?**

A15: Yes, you can select multiple payments from your Search Results by checking multiple boxes before pressing Print. The system allows you to include all relevant payments processed on a selected date (when searching by Processed Date) or all payments for a selected service period (when searching by Service Period), giving you flexibility in creating comprehensive payment documentation.
