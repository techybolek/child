# Board Contract Year 2025 Child Care Provider Payment Rates - Q&A

## Questions and Answers

**Q1: When do the Board Contract Year 2025 child care provider payment rates become effective?**

A1: The Board Contract Year 2025 child care provider payment rates become effective on January 13, 2025. These rates are documented in WD Letter 19-24 and apply to all Texas Workforce Commission contracted child care providers across the state's workforce development boards.

**Q2: What are the different types of child care providers covered in the BCY 2025 payment rate structure?**

A2: The payment rate structure covers three types of child care providers: Licensed Child Care Centers (LCCC), Licensed Child Care Homes (LCCH), and Registered Child Care Homes (RCCH). Each provider type has different rate schedules based on their licensing status and the level of care they can provide.

**Q3: How do Texas Rising Star (TRS) ratings affect child care provider payment rates?**

A3: Texas Rising Star ratings significantly increase payment rates above the regular (Reg) rates. Providers with TRS2, TRS3, or TRS4 ratings receive progressively higher reimbursement rates, with TRS4 being the highest. For example, in Alamo-20, a regular LCCC receives $44.40 for full-time care of 0-11 month olds, while TRS2 receives $46.63, TRS3 receives $47.57, and TRS4 receives $48.53 for the same service.

**Q4: What is the difference between full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) payment rates?**

A4: Full-time (FT) rates are paid for children receiving more extensive daily care, while part-time (PT) rates are lower and apply to children receiving fewer hours of care per day or week. Part-time rates are typically 15-25% lower than full-time rates for the same age group and provider type. For instance, in Capital Area-14, infant full-time care at a regular LCCC is $62.40, while part-time is $54.40.

**Q5: How do payment rates vary by child age groups?**

A5: Payment rates decrease as children get older, reflecting the different care requirements and staff-to-child ratios. The age categories are: 0-11 months (infants, highest rates), 12-17 months, 18-23 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, and 6-13 years (school-age, lowest rates). Infant care typically commands the highest rates due to intensive care needs and lower staff-to-child ratios required by regulations.

**Q6: What is the Texas School Ready (TSR) rating and how does it compare to Texas Rising Star ratings?**

A6: Texas School Ready (TSR) is a quality rating designation for child care providers that focuses on school readiness standards. In the payment rate structure, TSR providers receive the same enhanced rates as TRS2 providers, making it equivalent to the second-tier Texas Rising Star rating. This provides an incentive for providers to achieve quality certification through either pathway.

**Q7: Which Texas workforce development board area has the highest child care payment rates for infants?**

A7: The Capital Area-14 workforce board has among the highest rates, with full-time infant care at a regular LCCC at $62.40 and reaching up to $68.20 for TRS4-rated centers. Gulf Coast-28 also has comparably high rates. These higher rates reflect the higher cost of living and operating child care businesses in these metropolitan areas (Austin and Houston regions respectively).

**Q8: How much more can a child care provider earn by achieving a TRS4 rating compared to remaining at regular (non-rated) status?**

A8: The increase varies by board area and provider type, but typically ranges from 8-12% higher for TRS4 versus regular rates. For example, in Dallas County-6, a regular LCCC receives $47.20 for infant full-time care, while a TRS4 LCCC receives $52.40 - an increase of $5.20 or approximately 11%. This financial incentive encourages providers to improve quality standards and pursue Texas Rising Star certification.

**Q9: What is the payment rate difference between Licensed Child Care Centers (LCCC) and Registered Child Care Homes (RCCH) for the same services?**

A9: Payment rates can be similar or vary depending on the board area and age group, but generally they are competitive. In some areas, rates are identical or very close; in others, one type may have slightly higher rates. For example, in Alamo-20 for infant full-time care at regular rating, both LCCC and RCCH receive $44.00. The similar rates ensure families have quality options across different care settings while providers receive fair compensation regardless of facility type.

**Q10: Which workforce board areas have the lowest child care provider payment rates, and what might this indicate?**

A10: Rural areas like Northeast Texas-7, West Central-9, and Deep East-17 tend to have the lowest payment rates, with regular LCCC infant full-time care rates around $31.80-$35.00 compared to $60+ in urban areas. These lower rates reflect the lower cost of living and operating expenses in rural Texas communities. However, this can also create challenges in recruiting and retaining quality child care providers in these areas, potentially creating child care deserts in rural regions.
