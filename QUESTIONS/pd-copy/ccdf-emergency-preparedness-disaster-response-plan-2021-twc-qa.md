## Questions and Answers

**Q1: What federal requirement mandates that Texas develop a statewide child care disaster plan?**

A1: The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 requires lead agencies to develop and maintain a comprehensive statewide disaster plan. Specifically, under §658E(c)(2)(U) of the Act and 45 CFR 98.16(aa), lead agencies must demonstrate how they will address the needs of children, including safe child care, before, during, and after a state of emergency declared by the governor or a major disaster as defined in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.

**Q2: Which Texas agencies are primarily responsible for child care operations during disasters, and what are their specific roles?**

A2: Two agencies share primary responsibility: The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) serves as the lead state agency for administering CCDF child care subsidies and coordinates with 28 Local Workforce Development Boards. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission's (HHSC) Child Care Regulation (CCR) division regulates all child care operations in Texas and serves as the primary contact and point of coordination for child care providers during emergencies. CCR tracks provider closures, promulgates emergency rules, approves waivers, and authorizes temporary relocations.

**Q3: What emergency provisions can TWC staff implement for families receiving child care subsidies without needing Commission approval?**

A3: TWC staff can direct Local Boards to implement several emergency provisions for families for up to three months without Commission action, including: extension of CCDF eligibility recertification periods for affected families, extension of the three-month period of continued child care for parents displaced from employment/education/training, exceptions to attendance reporting requirements when failure was beyond parent control, and exceptions to attendance standards for disaster-related absences.

**Q4: How long can TWC provide continued reimbursements to affected child care providers after a disaster without Commission approval?**

A4: TWC staff may direct Boards to implement continued reimbursements to affected providers for up to four weeks without Commission action. This is part of a broader set of emergency provisions for CCDF providers that can be implemented during the immediate aftermath of a disaster to support provider recovery.

**Q5: What is the Texas Child Care Availability Portal and how is it used during disasters?**

A5: The Texas Child Care Availability Portal is a communication tool that TWC and CCR coordinate to use during disasters. Providers that are open and operating use the portal to enter information about their available child care slots, while families who have lost access to child care use it to locate available care that meets their needs. TWC can also leverage the portal to collect data about disaster response needs, such as requirements for personal protective equipment or other supplies.

**Q6: What types of emergency preparedness plans are child care providers required to maintain under Texas regulations?**

A6: Child care providers must have written emergency preparedness plans that include procedures for: evacuating children to safe areas (with specific procedures for infants under 24 months and children with disabilities); communication plans with local authorities, parents, and CCR; evacuating with essential documentation including parent contacts, emergency authorization, and child tracking information; continuing care until children are released; reunifying children with parents after the emergency; and conducting regular practice drills (monthly fire drills and quarterly severe weather and lockdown drills).

**Q7: What role do Local Workforce Development Boards play in disaster recovery for child care services?**

A7: Boards play a key role in assisting disaster-affected communities by providing information, referrals, and access to resources for affected individuals and businesses. Workforce Solutions Offices help connect parents and child care providers with various assistance programs including FEMA assistance, TWC Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Small Business Administration resources, HHS programs, the Texas Child Care Availability Portal, DSHS emergency preparedness resources (Texas Ready), Help Me Grow Texas, and Child Care Health Consultants.

**Q8: How can CCDF quality funds be used to support child care providers after a disaster?**

A8: Under TWC's Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule and federal regulations, CCDF funds designated for quality activities may be used for minor remodeling and improvements to ensure providers meet state and local standards. During disasters, Boards may use local CCDF quality funds to help providers restore or remediate facilities or replace damaged and destroyed property such as classroom materials and furnishings. The Commission may also allocate state-level funds for facility repairs, replacement of damaged property, subsidies for essential workers' children, protective care subsidies, and capacity-building initiatives.

**Q9: What emergency provisions are available specifically for Texas Rising Star (TRS) providers during disaster recovery?**

A9: TWC staff can direct Boards to implement several emergency provisions for TRS providers for up to four weeks without Commission action, including: short-term assistance during recovery, exceptions to quarterly screening requirements, extension of scheduled assessments, and temporary suspension of unannounced monitoring visits. These provisions help maintain TRS certification status while providers focus on recovery efforts.

**Q10: What free training and technical assistance resources are available to help child care providers prepare for emergencies?**

A10: Providers can access several free resources through HHSC's website, including: Texas A&M AgriLife Extension trainings (Child Care and COVID-19 Courses, Emergency Planning for Child Care Providers, and Emergency Preparedness for Children with Special Needs), CCDBG Rule Changes interactive presentations on emergency preparedness requirements, Hurricane Preparedness Plans checklist, www.TexasReady.gov step-by-step emergency planning guide, and Emergency Preparedness Reminder information from CCR. Additionally, CCR requires providers to maintain liability insurance and provides information about the Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS) to protect records and assets.
