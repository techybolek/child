# Child Care Relief Funding - ARPA Stabilization Grant Q&A
## Commission Meeting Material October 19, 2021

Q1: How much ARPA Stabilization funding did Texas receive and what percentage must go directly to child care providers?
A1: Texas received $2,724,368,837 in ARPA Stabilization Grant Funds, of which at least 90% ($2,451,931,953) must be expended on grants directly to child care programs. These funds must be obligated by September 30, 2022 and fully expended by September 30, 2023.

Q2: What types of child care providers are eligible to receive the 2022 Child Care Relief Funding?
A2: Eligible providers must meet two criteria: (1) they must be either open to provide child care services or temporarily closed due to COVID-19 related reasons (public health, financial hardship, or other pandemic-related issues), and (2) they must be a CCR-permitted licensed center, licensed home, or registered home that is not on corrective action at the time of application.

Q3: What are the three federal certifications that providers must affirm to receive ARPA Stabilization funds?
A3: Providers must certify that they will: (1) implement policies in line with state, local, and CDC guidance when open and providing services; (2) pay each employee at least the same amount in weekly wages and maintain the same benefits, with no involuntary furloughs from application submission through the award duration; and (3) to the extent possible, provide relief from copayments and tuition payments for families enrolled, prioritizing families struggling to make payments.

Q4: How is the base funding amount calculated for each provider in the 2022 Child Care Relief Fund?
A4: The base funding is calculated using the provider's total licensed capacity (as reflected in CCR's CLASS system) multiplied by the average cost of child care at the 75th percentile based on provider type from the most recent Market Rate Survey within the provider's local workforce development area. This formula-based approach reduces burden on providers and follows federal guidance to use enrollment/capacity and regional cost estimates.

Q5: What enhanced funding opportunities are available beyond the base grant amount?
A5: Providers can receive enhanced funding for: (1) Quality ratings - Texas Rising Star providers receive 13% for 2-Star, 25% for 3-Star, or 38% for 4-Star certification; (2) Child Care Deserts - 10% enhancement for providers in areas where children under six with working parents outnumber licensed capacity by at least 3:1; and (3) Social Vulnerability Index - 10% enhancement for SVI scores of 0.750 or greater, or 5% enhancement for SVI scores of 0.600-0.749.

Q6: What is the timeline for providers to apply and receive the 2022 Child Care Relief Funding?
A6: TWC planned to make funds available on a rolling basis for three months starting January 2022. Providers permitted as of December 31, 2021 would receive invitations in January/February 2022, those permitted in January 2022 would receive invitations in February/March, and those permitted in February 2022 would receive invitations in March/April. All providers had until May 31, 2022 to submit applications, with the last qualifying date being February 28, 2022.

Q7: How are the stabilization awards distributed to providers and when must funds be spent?
A7: Awards are distributed in two increments: the first half is sent upon completion and approval of the provider's application, and the second half is sent in August, September, or October 2022 depending on when the provider was permitted. Providers have until May 31, 2023 to expend all funding received.

Q8: What is the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and why is it used in determining grant amounts?
A8: The SVI is a CDC measure using 15 Census variables to identify communities that may need additional support during disasters. It considers socioeconomic status, household composition, minority status, housing type, and transportation factors. TWC uses SVI to provide enhanced funding to providers in high-need areas, with census tracts scoring 0.750+ receiving a 10% enhancement and those scoring 0.600-0.749 receiving a 5% enhancement.

Q9: What documentation and reporting requirements must providers maintain for the Child Care Relief Funding?
A9: Providers must maintain records documenting how they used the funds and how they met the three federal certification requirements. Additionally, they must report federally required data including address/zip code, race/ethnicity and gender of the center director or family child care owner, whether they serve subsidized children, their operational status at application, and how award funds were used. Providers selected for monitoring must provide this documentation to TWC upon request.

Q10: What additional information does TWC collect beyond federal requirements in the application process?
A10: TWC collects data by age group (infant, toddler, preschool, school-aged) including licensed capacity, average enrollment pre-pandemic, average enrollment at time of application, and number of vacant seats (which is uploaded to TWC's Availability Portal). For temporarily closed providers, TWC also requests closure date and planned reopening date. This additional information helps TWC evaluate the impact of the Child Care Relief Fund program.
