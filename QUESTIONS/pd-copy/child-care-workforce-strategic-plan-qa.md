# Texas Child Care Workforce Strategic Plan 2023-2025 - Q&A

## Q1: What is House Bill 619 (HB 619) and what does it require from the Texas Workforce Commission?
**A1:** House Bill 619, passed by the 87th Texas Legislature in 2021, requires the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) to develop a strategic plan to support and expand the child care workforce in Texas. The plan must assess the current state of the workforce, identify barriers to workforce development, and establish goals and strategies to address workforce needs. TWC must submit this plan biennially to the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Speaker of the House of Representatives.

## Q2: What are the three main strategic goals outlined in the Texas Child Care Workforce Strategic Plan?
**A2:** The three main strategic goals are: (1) **Expand the Child Care Workforce** - focusing on recruiting new workers, retaining current staff, and supporting re-entry of former workers through strategies like workforce development programs and career pathway initiatives; (2) **Strengthen the Child Care Workforce** - emphasizing professional development, educational opportunities, and credential attainment through TECPDS and other support systems; and (3) **Support the Child Care Workforce** - addressing compensation, benefits, working conditions, and overall job satisfaction to create sustainable careers in early childhood education.

## Q3: What is the median hourly wage for child care educators in Texas according to the Director Survey?
**A3:** According to the Director Survey conducted for this strategic plan, the median hourly wage for child care educators in Texas is $12.00 per hour. This represents a significant challenge for workforce retention, as this wage is often insufficient to support individuals and families, contributing to high turnover rates in the industry. The survey also found considerable variation in wages based on factors such as education level, experience, geographic location, and facility type.

## Q4: How is child care primarily funded in Texas, and what role does the Child Care Services (CCS) program play?
**A4:** Child care in Texas is primarily funded through private family payments, which account for approximately 85% of all child care funding in the state. The Child Care Services (CCS) program, funded through the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), provides subsidized child care assistance to eligible low-income families but currently serves only about 12% of eligible children due to funding limitations. This heavy reliance on private payments creates affordability challenges for families and sustainability challenges for providers trying to maintain adequate staffing and compensation levels.

## Q5: What is the Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS) and how does it support the workforce?
**A5:** TECPDS is Texas's comprehensive professional development system designed to support child care professionals throughout their careers. It provides a registry for tracking professional development, career pathways guidance, scholarship and financial assistance programs, access to training and educational opportunities, and support for credential attainment such as the Child Development Associate (CDA) credential. TECPDS serves as a central hub connecting child care professionals with resources, training providers, and educational institutions to advance their knowledge and skills in early childhood education.

## Q6: What are the key demographic characteristics of Texas's child care workforce according to the Director Survey?
**A6:** The Director Survey reveals that the Texas child care workforce is overwhelmingly female (approximately 95%) and racially/ethnically diverse, with significant representation of Hispanic/Latino workers. The workforce spans various age groups, with many educators in their 30s and 40s, though there's also representation of younger workers entering the field and more experienced educators. Educational attainment varies widely, from high school diplomas to bachelor's degrees and beyond, with many workers pursuing additional credentials while employed. The survey also indicates that many educators work in the field because of their passion for working with children, despite the relatively low compensation.

## Q7: What percentage of child care educators hold specific educational credentials, and what gaps exist?
**A7:** The Director Survey found that approximately 35% of child care educators hold a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential or higher-level early childhood credential, while about 20% have an associate degree or higher in early childhood education or a related field. However, significant gaps remain, with many educators lacking formal early childhood credentials despite having general education credentials. The strategic plan identifies increasing credential attainment as a priority, particularly for the CDA credential, which is recognized nationally and can serve as a stepping stone to higher education in the field.

## Q8: How does the strategic plan propose to support high school students interested in child care careers?
**A8:** The plan proposes several strategies to create pathways for high school students, including expanding Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs in early childhood education, developing dual credit opportunities that allow students to earn both high school and college credits simultaneously, creating apprenticeship and work-based learning programs in child care settings, and partnering with school districts to promote early childhood education as a viable career path. These initiatives aim to build a pipeline of qualified workers entering the field with foundational knowledge and credentials, helping to address workforce shortages while providing students with meaningful career opportunities.

## Q9: What are the primary barriers to expanding child care capacity in Texas, and what is the estimated economic impact?
**A9:** The primary barriers to expanding capacity include workforce shortages (inability to hire and retain qualified staff), inadequate compensation and benefits that make it difficult to compete with other industries, regulatory requirements that must be met for staffing ratios, and limited physical infrastructure. The plan cites research indicating that inadequate child care access costs Texas an estimated $8.74 billion annually in lost economic activity due to parents being unable to work or working reduced hours. Workforce challenges are identified as the most critical barrier, as facilities often have physical space available but cannot serve additional children without adequate staffing.

## Q10: What is the purpose of the Cost of Quality Study mentioned in the strategic plan?
**A10:** The Cost of Quality Study is an initiative designed to determine the true cost of providing high-quality child care services in Texas, including adequate compensation for educators and staff. This study will examine operational costs, staffing expenses, quality standards requirements, and sustainable business models to identify the gap between current reimbursement rates and the actual cost of quality care. The findings will inform policy recommendations for adjusting subsidy rates, establishing quality benchmarks, and potentially restructuring funding mechanisms to ensure that child care providers can maintain quality standards while paying educators competitive wages that support workforce retention and professional growth.
