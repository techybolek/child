# Texas Provider Cost of Quality Calculator (PCQC) User Guide - Q&A

## Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is the Texas Provider Cost of Quality Calculator (PCQC) and who should use it?**

A1: The Texas PCQC is a tool designed to help child care providers and policymakers estimate annual costs and revenues associated with operating a child care program. It's intended for child care center providers, directors, staff, and the policy community. The calculator generates a detailed revenue and expense statement to help providers understand quality drivers that influence the cost of care and manage a financially sustainable child care center.

**Q2: Does the calculator save my data, and do I need to create an account to use it?**

A2: No, users do not need to log in to use the Texas PCQC, and the calculator does not save or store any data entered by users. If you navigate away from the results page without printing or saving as a PDF, all information will be lost and must be re-entered from the beginning. Users should print or save their results using the "Print/Save PDF" button on the results page before starting a new scenario.

**Q3: How does the calculator handle mandatory benefits and taxes for employees?**

A3: The Texas PCQC automatically calculates average mandatory training costs as well as state and federal mandatory benefits based on the number of personnel you have. This includes State Unemployment Tax at 2.7%, Social Security and Medicare at 7.65%, and Federal Unemployment Tax at 6%. This information is sourced from the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act and the Internal Revenue Service for Social Security and Medicare Withholding rates.

**Q4: What information do I need to have ready before using the calculator?**

A4: You'll need basic information about your child care center including: county location, Texas Rising Star participation level, daily hours of operation (for under 5 and school-age children), number of children in each age group (0-11 months through school age), total number of classrooms, student-to-teacher ratios, and desired maximum group sizes. You'll also need information about personnel costs, benefits offered, occupancy costs (rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance), operational costs, and revenue including tuition rates and subsidy information.

**Q5: How do I adjust staff compensation in the calculator?**

A5: The calculator provides two methods to increase staff compensation above regional averages. You can either increase by percentage (using a slider bar to select the desired percentage over regional average) OR by entering a specific annual dollar amount increase. Important: The calculator will NOT calculate both methods simultaneously - you must choose one. Any compensation increases you enter will impact ALL staff positions at the child care center.

**Q6: What is breakeven tuition and how is it calculated?**

A6: Breakeven tuition is the monthly tuition amount automatically populated by the calculator that you would need to charge per child to cover all your costs without any profit. This calculation does not account for other forms of revenue like subsidized tuition, CACFP food reimbursements, or other revenue sources. The breakeven tuition shown in Step 4: Revenue is not adjusted for subsidies selected - those adjustments appear in the final results page.

**Q7: How does the calculator handle Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) subsidies?**

A7: If you opt into the CACFP, the calculator treats food program subsidies as a pass-through cost savings to parents/guardians rather than revenue to the center. You'll enter the percentage of students in three income brackets: those receiving free meals (family income less than 130% FPL), price-reduced meals (130-185% FPL), and lower-rate subsidies (greater than 185% FPL). The results show a "Food Program Subsidy Tuition Adjustment" that subtracts food reimbursements from total tuition revenue, which has a net zero impact on total revenue.

**Q8: Why can't I mix school-age children with younger age groups in the same classroom?**

A8: Children six years and older are often enrolled in after-school programs with different hours of operation and staffing arrangements than programs for younger children. Keeping school-age children in separate classrooms ensures the calculator yields the most accurate results based on the distinct operational requirements, such as different daily hours during the school year (August through May) versus summer months (June through July).

**Q9: What are employee child care benefits and how do I enter them in the calculator?**

A9: Some child care providers offer free or reduced tuition to their staff members as an employee benefit. In the calculator, you can enter the percentage discount you plan to offer and specify the number of children in each classroom who will receive this discounted rate. The calculator will then apply that discount to the tuition rates entered in the revenue section, and the cost will be reflected in your overall financial calculations.

**Q10: Where does the default data in the calculator come from?**

A10: Default salary and hourly wage data primarily comes from the Texas Labor Market Information website under Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS). Default non-personnel expense data comes from the Center for American Progress's True Cost of Child Care project for Texas and the Administration on Children and Families' Provider Cost of Quality Calculator. Benefits data comes from the Texas Workforce Commission and Texas Health and Human Services websites. Default staff salaries and wages are adjusted based on your selected county location and Texas Rising Star program participation level.
