# Evaluation of Effectiveness of Subsidized Child Care Program - Report to 84th Legislature
## Question and Answer Pairs

### Q1: What is the primary purpose of TWC's subsidized child care program?
**A1:** The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) provides subsidized child care as a support service to help parents become and remain employed and contribute to the Texas economy. It addresses a common barrier to employment by making affordable child care available to parents, and also enhances their ability to participate in workforce training activities. To receive subsidized child care, parents must be employed or participating in training or education activities leading to employment.

### Q2: What were the employment outcomes for TANF parents receiving subsidized child care in 2011-2012?
**A2:** For parents receiving both TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) and TWC-subsidized child care from 2011-2012, the outcomes were strong: 72 percent found employment, and 68 percent maintained employment after one year. These parents participated in TWC's Choices program for workforce training and work-related activities.

### Q3: How effective was subsidized child care in helping non-TANF parents maintain employment?
**A3:** Subsidized child care proved to be a vital work support for non-TANF parents. For those receiving TWC-subsidized child care from 2011-2012, 85 percent maintained employment after one year. Additionally, parents receiving subsidized child care in 2011 experienced an average quarterly wage gain of 6 percent, while those receiving it in 2012 experienced an average quarterly wage gain of 11 percent after one year.

### Q4: What were the main reasons children left TWC-subsidized child care between October 2012 and September 2013?
**A4:** During that period, 116,047 children left TWC-subsidized child care for at least one month. The top reasons were: Parent missed redetermination/did not return paperwork (25.5%), parent voluntarily withdrew from child care (20.8%), termination per Choices case manager for non-cooperation/voluntary withdrawal (15.1%), parent no longer meeting work, training, or education requirements (11.3%), and termination per WFC case manager (10.1%).

### Q5: What happened to parents after their children left subsidized child care - did they end up on TANF?
**A5:** The data shows positive outcomes: for all parents whose children left TWC-subsidized child care in 2011 and 2012, 87 percent did not receive TANF within 12 months of their children leaving care. This indicates that most families remained self-sufficient without needing cash assistance after losing child care subsidies.

### Q6: What is Rider 30 and how was the funding allocated for professional development?
**A6:** Rider 30 of TWC's general appropriation from the 83rd Texas Legislature required TWC to dedicate $1 million over Fiscal Years 2014-2015 for programs encouraging increased participation in continuing professional development for early childhood professionals. The funding was split: $500,000 went to the Texas Association for the Education of Young Children (TAEYC) for scholarships, and $500,000 went to DFPS to expand online training courses related to health and safety for child care providers and caregivers.

### Q7: What were the scholarship goals under the TAEYC contract, and how was progress tracking by October 2014?
**A7:** TWC entered into a 24-month contract with TAEYC to award 80 CDA/CCP scholarships and 74 associate's degree scholarships. By October 2014, at 25% project completion, progress was strong: 28 CDA/CCP scholarships had been awarded (35% of target), 24 associate's degree scholarships had been awarded (30.7% of target), and 10 caregivers had already obtained their CDA credential (28.5% of the target of 35).

### Q8: What are Local Workforce Development Boards required to do under House Bill 376 regarding quality child care initiatives?
**A8:** House Bill 376, enacted by the 83rd Texas Legislature, requires each Local Workforce Development Board to use at least 2 percent of their annual allocation from TWC for quality child care initiatives and to hire staff to provide mentoring assistance to providers who want to meet Texas Rising Star certification requirements or increase their certification level.

### Q9: How did Local Workforce Development Boards leverage local funds with colleges, universities, and school districts in FY 2014?
**A9:** Boards were highly effective at leveraging local resources: they entered into 56 agreements with colleges and universities that certified approximately $11.9 million in expenses as match to draw down approximately $24.1 million in federal CCDF funds. Additionally, they entered into 68 agreements with ISDs where the districts contributed approximately $10.4 million in local funds, drawing down approximately $21.1 million in federal CCDF funds for child care services and quality improvement activities.

### Q10: What is the Texas School Ready! (TSR!) project and what were its 2012-2013 achievements?
**A10:** The Texas School Ready! (TSR!) project is a high-quality early childhood model administered by the Children's Learning Institute (CLI) using $11.7 million in federal CCDF funds transferred from TWC to TEA annually. It's based on proven school readiness components including high-quality curriculum, continuous student progress monitoring, professional development for teachers, and School Readiness Integration Partnerships. During the 2012-2013 school year, TSR! served 44,526 students in 2,506 classrooms across participating communities.
