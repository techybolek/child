# Early Childhood System Needs Assessment in Texas - Part 2 (Methodology) Q&A

Q1: What was the final sample size for the Family Survey and how many respondents had a child with a developmental delay or disability?
A1: The final analysis sample was 1,890 respondents, of which 633 indicated that they had a child with a developmental delay or disability. Additionally, 338 of the respondents were from micropolitan, small town, or rural areas of the state, while the remaining were from metropolitan areas.

Q2: What quality control measures were implemented during the Family Survey data collection process?
A2: Out of 5,400 survey attempts, 1,314 respondents were automatically stopped from completing the survey due to inconsistency in their responses or because they progressed through the survey too quickly. Additionally, 2,089 respondents were analyzed for further anomalies, and 199 were excluded because of anomalies related to response patterns, such as services received not matching income to household size information.

Q3: What validated scales and measures were used in the Family Survey to assess family well-being?
A3: The survey used the Family Quality of Life scale, which measures the family's internal support, emotional well-being, material well-being, and parenting support. Families with a child with a developmental delay or disability were also asked about their disability-related support. The survey also included trust questions about child-serving institutions that have been used with other populations in Texas.

Q4: How did the Family Survey address trust in child-serving institutions?
A4: Respondents were asked about their general trust in two child-serving institutions: pediatrics and child care. Those respondents who had a child with a developmental delay or disability were also asked about their trust in early intervention services. These trust questions were taken from several surveys and have been used with other populations in Texas.

Q5: What demographic characteristics showed notable patterns in the Family Survey responses?
A5: Responses for those without a child with a developmental delay or disability generally skewed to be white non-Hispanic at a higher rate than the child demographics in the state, but otherwise followed the overall demographics of the state. Among respondents who have a child with a developmental delay or disability, there was a high proportion of respondents who were Black or African American.

Q6: How were child care providers selected for the Child Care Director Interviews?
A6: Participants were selected from a publicly available list of childcare providers obtained from Child Care Regulation. Child care providers were filtered based on the availability of the director's email contact information, if the childcare center offered care to children 0 to 5 years old, and were located within Texas. Childcare centers were randomly and conveniently selected within each major geographic area of Texas, with additional sites selected to provide representation of medium-size, large, and home-based childcare operations.

Q7: What were the main focus areas covered in the Child Care Director Interviews?
A7: Questions for semi-structured interviews were open-ended questions that aimed to identify the needs of childcare centers related to workforce and training, as well as the impacts of COVID-19 on child care staff, behavioral management, and screening and referrals for child development. Additional probing questions were asked based on responses to ensure complete understanding of the subject.

Q8: What data analysis approaches were used for the Child Care Director Interviews?
A8: Content analysis was used to record direct responses to questions, allowing development of a codebook based on interview questions. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify larger content areas that provided contextual understanding connecting responses. It was also used to highlight underlying meaning or bridge questions in unexpected ways. A single coder who attended all interviews completed both rounds of coding.

Q9: What was the final sample composition for the Child Care Director Interviews?
A9: In total, 19 interviews were completed. One interview included two participants (the Director and Assistant Director), while all other interviews included only a single person who was either the Director or Director/Owner. All areas of the state were represented. Most preschools and childcare centers were center-based (n=17), while home-based childcare providers were included (n=2). Most childcare centers were participating in or working toward designation in the Texas Rising Star quality rating program (n=16), and participants represented a mix of for-profit (n=12) and not-for-profit childcare centers (n=6).

Q10: How were interviews conducted and recorded for the Child Care Director study?
A10: All interviews were scheduled via email or phone for a 60-minute Zoom interview with two researchers. The primary interviewer asked most questions while the secondary interviewer ensured all questions were answered and asked follow-up questions when needed. All interviews were completed virtually on Zoom and were audio recorded, with informed consent read before recording. Audio recordings were uploaded to Rev for professional transcription, then downloaded as Microsoft Word Documents and uploaded to NVIVO for qualitative data management.

Q11: What was the target population for the Early Childhood Workforce Survey?
A11: The targeted study population was a director working within child care or Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) and those that provide direct care or support to children in these settings in Texas. The family support sector was not included as they were currently being included in a statewide evaluation.

Q12: How were child care sites sampled for the Early Childhood Workforce Survey?
A12: The survey was sent to a representative sample of child care centers and home-based child care providers in the state (n=208). The child care site population was defined as all licensed sites that are currently open with active licenses and publicly available email addresses. Sites were assigned to Rural Urban Commuting Areas (RUCA) based on their operating location and randomly sampled using a proportional-to-size approach that included center/home-based and RUCA as strata.

Q13: What validated scales were used in the Early Childhood Workforce Survey to measure attitudes and workplace factors?
A13: The survey used the Attitude Related to Trauma Informed Care scale (10-item child care version), a job stress inventory developed in the child care setting that measures three domains (control over environment, fulfillment with job, and demands of the job), and an adapted version of the mindfulness in teaching scale. The survey also used items adapted from the organizational health inventory used in schools.

Q14: What training topics were included in the Early Childhood Workforce Survey for child care and Pre-K staff?
A14: Respondents were asked if they had completed continuing education or specialized training in: warm and responsive style, language facilitation and support, play-based interactions and guidance, support for children's self-regulation, instructional formats and approaches to learning, and scoring and interpreting developmental screeners. They indicated whether training occurred never, more than a year ago, or in the past year.

Q15: How did the Early Childhood Workforce Survey address professional development compensation?
A15: Respondents were asked if their employer pays them for the time spent on professional development (counting training time as work hours). Response options included: no pay for any professional development hours, payment for some but not all required hours, payment for all required hours but not additional hours, or payment for all required and additional hours.

Q16: What questions were asked specifically to directors about non-traditional hours child care?
A16: Directors were asked about their hours of operation and, for those offering care before 8 am, after 6 pm, or on weekends, they were asked about facilitators and barriers to offering care during these times. They rated agreement with statements about reasons for offering (or not offering) non-traditional hours care, including earning more money, attracting more families, meeting scheduling needs, partnering with employers, and meeting community needs.

Q17: What was the final sample size for the Early Childhood Workforce Survey?
A17: The sample included 60 child care workers and 86 early intervention workers. Of the childcare workforce, 47 were also a director or an owner of a home-based child care site. Of the early intervention workers, 23 were supervisors.

Q18: What questions were asked about ECI providers' use of teletherapy?
A18: ECI providers were asked to rate their agreement with statements about whether therapies are more effective when provided in person, whether families prefer therapies provided in person, and whether therapists prefer to provide therapy in person. They were also asked what percentage of time they provided services by televisit in the past year, with response options ranging from 0-20% to 80-100%.

Q19: What family-centered practices were assessed in the Early Childhood Workforce Survey?
A19: Respondents rated the extent to which they: suggested activities fitting family needs, offered positive feedback, established rapport, discussed expectations with other providers, told parents about additional services, accepted parents non-judgmentally, trusted parents as experts, discussed family feelings, answered questions completely, provided written information, treated parents as equals, helped parents feel like partners, promoted family-to-family connections, provided support to cope with impacts, and had information available about different concerns.

Q20: What specific questions were asked of child care directors about developmental screening practices?
A20: Directors were asked if they conduct developmental screenings, what types of tools they use (such as ASQ, CDI, M-CHAT, curriculum-provided assessments, or self-developed assessments), who conducts the screenings (director, family support specialist, or teachers), and what type of training staff receive to administer and score the developmental screens (online training by publisher, third-party training, or training through local ECI provider).

Q21: How were early childhood coalitions identified for the Coalition study?
A21: Early childhood coalitions in the state were identified through state agency partners, web searches, and other stakeholder conversations. This resulted in a list of 42 early childhood coalitions with a probable primary contact. All of these contacts were sent an email explaining the study and inviting them to participate.

Q22: What incentives were offered to coalitions for survey participation?
A22: Coalitions were offered a $2000 donation in goods if 80% of the coalition responded to the survey and $1000 if 50% of the coalition responded to the survey. This incentive structure was designed to encourage high response rates among coalition members.

Q23: What was the difference between the coalition leader survey and the coalition member survey?
A23: Main contacts/leaders were asked to fill out a survey or pass it along to the leadership team, with questions focusing on the structure and governance of the coalition. Coalition members were sent a survey that focused on their organization's or program's role in the coalition and the resources the program/organization contributed. Members were also given a random sample of 15-20 other organizations and asked to rate that organization's contribution to the coalition.

Q24: What was the focus of the Early Matters interviews?
A24: Early Matters interviews focused on coalitions that exclusively focus on the preschool and child care landscape as a route to improve school readiness locally. A joint interview with two Early Matters state leaders focused on the history and purpose of these coalitions and the support provided to other Early Matters coalitions. Two other interviews focused on the function and goal of the coalition, how business leaders were incorporated, and their interaction with other early childhood coalitions in their area.

Q25: What was the final participation rate for the coalition surveys?
A25: Sixteen coalition leaders or contacts responded to the initial survey, and 136 coalition members responded to the member survey. This represents participation from a portion of the 42 identified coalitions.

Q26: What types of questions were asked about coalition data use practices?
A26: Coalition members were asked whether their coalition reviews community-level metrics of risk and need, reviews community metrics disaggregated by race/ethnicity or poverty, shares aggregate data about client characteristics, collects data showing the reach of activities, can track how families move between different services, collects data showing impact of activities, and has adequate data to make decisions about needs in the community and assess the impact of their work.

Q27: How did the coalition survey assess inter-organizational relationships?
A27: Coalition members were given a random sample of 15-20 other organizations in their coalition and asked to rate each organization's help with influence within the community, directly providing help to families, and providing resources for families. They also rated whether the organization's departure would mean activities wouldn't get done, whether the organization provides funding and material support central to the coalition, and whether the organization is a reliable partner.

Q28: What structural characteristics of coalitions were assessed in the survey?
A28: Coalitions indicated whether: one agency provides administrative support, the leading organization changes on a timeline, there is a charter or by-laws, there is a strategic plan developed by the coalition, there is a mission statement, organizations not involved in core focus are invited to meetings, one organization leads execution while others advise, activities are performed by more than one organization, and the coalition has completed at least one community event in the past year.

Q29: How did the coalition survey address family engagement and advisory structures?
A29: Coalitions were asked if they have a family advisory board or family representative, and if yes, whether family members are paid for their time, provided training about early childhood services, help design community outreach activities, are given specific time on meeting agendas to discuss emerging needs, and were involved in strategic planning or had major influence on coalition activities. Coalitions were also asked to describe how families were chosen.

Q30: What questions were asked about coalition information-sharing practices related to family support?
A30: Coalition members rated the extent to which their coalition shares information that provides advice on how to connect parents to each other (through resource libraries, support groups, or the Internet), provides opportunities for the entire family to obtain information about early childhood issues, and provides advice on how to support or help families cope with the impact of their child's difficult behaviors (such as parenting programs, counseling, or direct support).

Q31: What pandemic-related experiences were assessed in the Family Survey?
A31: Respondents were asked if they or anyone in their home experienced any of the following between March 2020 and the end of 2022: loss of employment, began a new job, lapse in child care for more than 1 month, needed to move due to housing affordability, death of family member or close friend, bought a home, went more than 1 day with little or no food, went through a divorce, had a child diagnosed with a developmental delay or disorder, had difficulty obtaining diapers/formula/baby care products, making less money than at the beginning, or had difficulty obtaining medical care or prescriptions.

Q32: How did the Family Survey assess the impact of the pandemic on children?
A32: Using a sliding scale from 1 to 20, respondents rated the pandemic's impact on their child(ren) younger than 6 in the following areas: overall social development, learning or progress in school, general health, and behavior. Each scale ranged from "very positive" to "neutral" to "very negative." Respondents were also asked an open-ended question about the biggest need their child/children have moving forward.

Q33: What specific child care arrangement questions were included in the Family Survey?
A33: Respondents indicated all types of child care help they have (from child care centers to relatives to informal arrangements), then selected the one they use most often. They rated satisfaction with location relative to work/school and home, quality, cost, hours of availability, ability to accommodate their schedule, and ability to accommodate their child's needs. They also provided their actual hours and days of child care use and their ideal hours if money and availability were not issues.

Q34: What factors were parents asked to consider when choosing child care arrangements?
A34: Parents selected the 5 most important factors from a list including: keeping child in same arrangement as siblings, location near work/school or home, flexible hours, only arrangement with openings, could accommodate child's special needs, cost of care, eligible for subsidy, individualized attention, reviews/reputation, accreditation/licensing, quality of caregivers, cleanliness/illness prevention, safe physical setting, opportunities for cognitive development and social-emotional learning, provider's values, trust, discipline approaches, bilingual opportunities, and diversity of children and teachers.

Q35: How did the Early Childhood Workforce Survey assess difficult conversations with parents?
A35: Respondents indicated their comfort level (from very uncomfortable to completely comfortable) talking to parents about eight topics: their child's positive behavior, physical health or development, learning difficulties, eating habits, challenging behavior, hygiene, social or emotional difficulties, and disciplinary strategies to use with their child. This assessed workers' preparedness for various types of parent communication.

Q36: What questions about job stress and control were included in the workforce survey?
A36: Using a job stress inventory developed for child care settings, respondents rated how often various stressors occur (from very rarely to very frequently) and how much control they have over various aspects of work (from very little to very much). The inventory measures three domains: control over their environment and conditions, fulfillment with the job, and demands of the job. Three items were excluded for those in ECI.

Q37: How did the workforce survey assess mindfulness in working with children?
A37: Respondents completed an adapted version of the mindfulness in teaching scale with items rated from "never true" to "always true." Items were worded to be general and applicable to anyone who works with children, with "teach" replaced by "work with." Examples include: "When I am working with children it seems I am 'running on automatic,' without much awareness of what I am doing" and "When I'm upset with a child at work, I notice how I am feeling before I take action."

Q38: What organizational climate questions were asked of direct care staff in the workforce survey?
A38: Direct care staff received 19 items adapted from the organizational health inventory used in schools, focusing on the role of the director in creating a positive work environment and the support between staff. Questions addressed whether the director explores all sides of topics, treats staff as equals, shows appreciation, discusses classroom issues, accepts questions, conducts meaningful evaluations, maintains performance standards, is friendly and approachable, and looks out for staff welfare, among other factors.

Q39: What questions were asked about capacity to serve children with special needs?
A39: Child care directors were asked if their program reserves or prioritizes slots for children receiving ECI or ECSE services, if they reserve slots for children in foster care, if their facility has a quiet space for therapists to work with children, if they have served children with physical disabilities, and what factors have impacted their ability to serve children with physical disabilities (such as playground accessibility, staff support capabilities, or insurance requirements).

Q40: How did director surveys assess trauma-informed care implementation?
A40: Directors rated the degree to which statements are true about their program (not at all true, somewhat true, mostly true, or completely true) regarding: hiring preference for candidates with trauma-informed care experience, ongoing training in trauma-specific evidence-based practices, support staff receiving ongoing training in integrating trauma-informed care principles, performance evaluations including trauma-informed care standards, and having a written process to regularly evaluate and monitor performance on trauma-informed care.
