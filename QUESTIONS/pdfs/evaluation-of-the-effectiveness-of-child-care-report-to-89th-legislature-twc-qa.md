# Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Subsidized Child Care Program - Q&A

## Report to the 89th Texas Legislature (January 15, 2025)

### Q1: What is the primary purpose of TWC's subsidized child care program?
**A1:** TWC provides subsidized child care as a support service to help parents become and remain employed and contribute to the Texas economy. Making affordable child care available addresses a common barrier to employment and enhances parents' ability to participate in workforce training activities. To receive subsidized child care, parents must be employed, participating in training, or participating in education activities that lead to employment.

### Q2: How effective is subsidized child care in helping TANF parents find and maintain employment?
**A2:** In 2022, approximately 88 percent of parents receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) found employment within 12 months of receiving child care. However, maintaining employment after one year shows more variation, with 58.81% of TANF parents maintaining employment one year after entering child care in 2022. This demonstrates that while subsidized child care is highly effective at helping TANF parents find work, sustained employment support remains a challenge.

### Q3: What wage gains do non-TANF parents experience after receiving subsidized child care?
**A3:** Non-TANF parents who maintain employment 12 months after receiving child care experienced an average quarterly wage gain of $1,871 in 2022 (equivalent to $7,484 annually). Additionally, approximately 87 percent of non-TANF parents maintained employment 12 months after receiving child care. This demonstrates that subsidized child care is an effective work support service that enables parents to not only stay employed but also increase their earnings.

### Q4: What is the Texas Rising Star program and how has it grown?
**A4:** Texas Rising Star is a quality-based rating system for Texas early childhood programs participating in TWC's subsidized child care program. It offers three levels of certification (Two-Star, Three-Star, and Four-Star) to encourage child care programs to attain progressively higher certification requirements. Since 2017, the number of programs certified by Texas Rising Star has increased 139 percent. As of September 2024, 3,303 child care and early learning programs participated in Texas Rising Star, representing approximately 48.5 percent of all programs with agreements to accept subsidized children.

### Q5: What are the main reasons parents leave the subsidized child care program?
**A5:** From October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024, the main reasons for leaving were: 35.87% of children left because parents missed redetermination and/or did not return paperwork; 25.02% left because parents voluntarily withdrew from child care; 27.22% left because the family was no longer eligible; 7.84% left due to permanent end of activities after three-month job search; and only 0.06% left due to excessive absences. Only 3.36% of parents who left the child care program received TANF within one year of leaving in 2022, down from 13.07% in 2018.

### Q6: How does TWC set provider reimbursement rates to encourage participation in quality programs?
**A6:** Beginning with FY 2024, TWC sets minimum threshold rates as follows: (1) Base rates are first set at the 75th percentile of the local market rate for each age group and type of care; (2) Rates are then compared to the Cost of Quality/Price Modeling Report, and if the CoQ price is higher, the rate is set to the higher amount; (3) Rates are compared to the previous year's rates, and if any rate would drop, the previous year's higher rate is maintained. Texas Rising Star enhanced reimbursement rates remain at least 5%, 7%, or 9% higher than base rates for Two-Star, Three-Star, and Four-Star certified providers, respectively.

### Q7: What is the Pre-K Partnership program and what progress has been made?
**A7:** Pre-K partnerships are collaborations between local education agencies (such as school districts or open-enrollment charter schools) and quality-rated child care programs to provide high-quality care and education to eligible three- and four-year-old children. Between June 2022 and June 2024, the TWC Pre-K Partnership department assisted with the development of 81 formal and 52 informal pre-K partnerships. Additionally, TWC awarded funds to 73 child care programs for a total of $2,250,000 disbursed for 63 pre-K-3 and 27 pre-K-4 partnership classrooms, with eligible programs receiving awards of up to $25,000 for each new pre-K partnership classroom.

### Q8: How does TWC coordinate with the Texas Education Agency (TEA) regarding PEIMS numbers for children in subsidized care?
**A8:** TWC collaborated with TEA to develop an automated interface and began assigning PEIMS (Public Education Information Management System) numbers to children under age six who were enrolled in subsidized child care on September 1, 2020. This allows for longitudinal analysis of information on children who receive subsidies by bridging their participation in early childhood programs to their participation in public education. As of November 2024, 99.34 percent of children younger than age six who are participating in the Child Care Services program had a PEIMS number in both TWC and TEA data systems.

### Q9: What professional development initiatives does TWC support for early childhood educators?
**A9:** TWC supports multiple professional development initiatives including: (1) Professional Development Scholarships through the T.E.A.C.H. program for CDA certificates, degrees, and apprenticeships; (2) Texas Rising Star Early Educator Conferences held three times annually; (3) Infant-Toddler Specialist Network serving 4,572 programs in FY 2024; (4) Staff retention programs focusing on director/owner leadership skills with 436 participants; (5) Planning for Individualized Instruction tools provided to 441 educators serving 2,400 children; (6) AgriLife Trainings with 115,837 participants accessing online courses; and (7) Registered Apprenticeship Programs supporting over 200 apprentices.

### Q10: How does House Bill 2607 affect the Texas Rising Star program implementation?
**A10:** HB 2607, passed by the 87th Texas Legislature in 2021, amended Texas Government Code §2308.3155 to require that all regulated providers of TWC-funded Child Care Services participate in the Texas Rising Star program. The bill also required creation of a new Entry Level designation with a maximum time limit for participation at that level. Effective October 3, 2022, TWC implemented Entry Level designation for 4,476 CCS providers that were not currently Texas Rising Star-certified and granted them 24 months to achieve at least a Two-Star certification. As of the end of FY 2024, over 1,800 CCS providers with an Entry Level designation end date of September 30, 2024, were granted a 12-month extension if they met certain criteria.
