# Texas Child Care Market Rate Survey Methodology - Q&A

Q1: What federal regulation requires Texas to conduct a market rate survey for child care services, and how often must it be conducted?
A1: 45 Code of Federal Regulations 98.45(c) requires Texas to conduct a statistically valid and reliable market rate survey (MRS) at least every three years as part of the Child Care Development Fund state plan. This survey must capture complete and current data from providers in the priced child care market and represent geographic variation across the state.

Q2: Who conducts the Texas Market Rate Survey and for which geographic areas are rates calculated?
A2: TWC contracts with the University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work and the Ray Marshall Center to conduct the Texas MRS. The survey creates statistically valid rate distributions for the entire state of Texas and for each of the 28 local workforce development areas (LWDAs), covering three provider facility types and four age groups.

Q3: What are the three types of child care provider facilities included in the market rate survey?
A3: The three types of child care provider facilities are: (1) Licensed Child Care Centers (LCCC), (2) Licensed Child Care Homes (LCCH), and (3) Registered Child Care Homes (RCCH). The survey collects and analyzes data separately for each facility type across all 28 LWDAs.

Q4: What are the four age groups for which child care rates are calculated in the survey?
A4: The four age groups are: (1) infants (0-17 months), (2) toddlers (18-35 months), (3) preschool-age children (36-71 months), and (4) school-age children (72 months and above). Rates are collected for both full-day (six hours or more) and part-day (fewer than six hours) care for each age group.

Q5: Why can't TWC administrative data alone be used to provide valid market rate estimates?
A5: TWC administrative data cannot be used alone for two key reasons: First, it does not fully capture the universe of providers in the priced child care market—past surveys indicate it only represents one-third of providers who complete the MRS. Second, it does not contain the number of slots for each facility by rate and age type, so the price per child care slot is not available and correct facility weights cannot be applied.

Q6: Which types of child care providers are excluded from the market rate survey sample?
A6: Excluded providers include: relative child care providers, Head Start facilities (don't charge families directly), drop-in care facilities (charge very high hourly rates not used for regular care), part-day care with no after-school care, programs for specific populations only (special needs, teen moms' children, company staff children), free/family-discounted services, kindergartens without regular afterschool care, summer camps, and nursery schools.

Q7: How does the survey methodology ensure adequate response rates from different geographic areas?
A7: The methodology uses a two-sample approach: first, a statewide representative sample of 1,000 facilities is randomly selected for greater statistical power. Second, an additional random sample is drawn with over-sampling of LWDAs with fewer facilities to concentrate statistical power where needed most. This approach, combined with quality communication, experienced interviewers, and follow-up letters, achieved 77% response from centers and 52% from homes in 2016.

Q8: What information does the market rate survey collect during telephone interviews?
A8: The survey collects: percentage of children receiving TWC/Board-subsidized care; enrollment numbers and daily rates for full-day and part-day care by age group; hours of operation; availability of care for children with disabilities; additional charges (registration/activity/transportation fees); administrative category (sectarian/nonsectarian, for-profit/nonprofit); national accreditation or Texas Rising Star status; payment practices for subsidy participants; and barriers to participation for non-participants.

Q9: How does the survey handle potential response bias to ensure all facility types are represented?
A9: Prior to computing final rate estimates, researchers conduct analyses of potential response bias using characteristics from DFPS listings, such as whether facilities offer transportation, weekend care, etc. If significant response bias is found, corrections are made by adjusting weights to account for the bias, ensuring the full range of facilities is adequately represented in the findings.

Q10: What is the "small-area estimation" methodology and why is it necessary for Texas?
A10: Small-area estimation is a specialized methodology needed because Texas LWDAs vary widely in size—the largest (Gulf Coast) contains more than ten times as many facilities as the four smallest boards combined. Traditional statistical methods would require at least 30 observations per area, which isn't feasible for smaller LWDAs. This approach estimates parameters that characterize the distribution of rates and applies them using assumptions of normality, resulting in more stable estimates over time even with limited observations in some areas.
