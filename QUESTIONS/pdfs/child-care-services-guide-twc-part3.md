# Questions and Answers: Child Care Services Guide - Part 3

## Q1: How are bonuses calculated for child care income eligibility?

**Answer:** Bonuses and lump sum payments are averaged over the applicable number of months they cover to reach an average monthly figure. For example:
- Annual bonuses are averaged by 12
- Quarterly bonuses are averaged by 3
- One-time payments are averaged by 12
- Lump sum payments are averaged by 12

Staff determines the number of months the bonus covers and whether there's an expectation of future repetition.

## Q2: How do I calculate my monthly income if I get paid biweekly?

**Answer:** For biweekly pay (every other week), multiply your average earnings per pay period by either 2.165 or 2.167, depending on the calculation methodology:
- 2.167 is based on 26 pay periods per year
- 2.165 is based on 4.33 weeks per month

The calculation process is:
1. Add gross pay from all pay stubs (less bonuses/lump sums)
2. Divide by total number of pay stubs to get average pay per pay period
3. Multiply by 2.165 or 2.167 to get base monthly earnings

## Q3: What income documentation is required for the previous three months?

**Answer:** You must provide documentation of all employment and income earned for the previous three-month period. This includes:
- Pay stubs covering the past 3 months (if paid monthly) or 12 weeks (if paid weekly/biweekly)
- Consecutive pay periods
- If you cannot provide required documents but the year-to-date information covers the period, that may be used
- If you started a new job or had substantial earnings changes, an Employment/Income Verification Form must be completed
- If paid in cash as an employee, an Employment/Income Verification Form completed by the employer is required

## Q4: Are there minimum work hour requirements for child care eligibility?

**Answer:** Yes. To be eligible for Child Care Services, parents must require child care to work or attend job training/education for:
- **Single-parent family:** At least an average of 25 hours per week
- **Two-parent family:** At least a combined total of 50 hours per week

For postsecondary undergraduate education:
- Each credit hour counts as 3 hours per week
- Each credit hour in condensed courses (summer semester) counts as 6 hours per week
- Teen parents attending high school or equivalent are considered to be meeting weekly activity requirements

## Q5: How is self-employment income calculated?

**Answer:** Self-employment income equals gross business income minus business operating expenses. Two options exist:

**Option 1 - Itemized Expenses:** Document and deduct operating expenses such as rent, utilities, gas for automobile, payroll, and booth rental.

**Option 2 - Standard Deduction:** Boards may offer a standard deduction option as a more efficient method. Parents have the option to itemize expenses or use gross income without the standard deduction.

For work hours verification, if you cannot provide documentation of hours worked, the federal minimum wage is applied to your net self-employment income to calculate participation hours.

## Q6: What happens if my income changes during the 12-month eligibility period?

**Answer:** During the 12-month eligibility period, full eligibility determination only occurs at initial determination and redetermination (12 months later).

**Income Increases:** You're only required to report substantial and permanent increases that would cause your family to exceed 85% of State Median Income (SMI). Temporary changes lasting 3 months or less don't affect eligibility.

**Income Decreases:** A new Parent Share of Cost (PSoC) must be assessed upon your report of a change in income, family size, or number of children in care that would result in a reduced PSoC. Documentation of the decrease is required when PSoC is reduced.

## Q7: What is the Initial Job Search child care program and who qualifies?

**Answer:** Initial Job Search child care is for parents who don't meet the minimum participation requirements for Low-Income child care at initial eligibility determination.

**Key features:**
- Initial 3-month period with no parent fee (PSoC set to zero)
- No income verification or activity hours required initially
- Family income must not exceed 85% of SMI
- Must register with WorkInTexas.com

**To continue beyond 3 months (up to 12 months total):**
- Single parents: Must have at least 25 hours/week total activity, including minimum 12 hours/week employment
- Dual parents: Must have combined 50 hours/week total activity, including minimum combined 25 hours/week employment

If requirements aren't met within 3 months, care is terminated. Only one Initial Job Search period is allowed per 12-month period.

## Q8: How does child care eligibility work for children experiencing homelessness?

**Answer:** Children experiencing homelessness (per the McKinney-Vento Act definition) have special eligibility provisions:

**Initial 3-month enrollment:**
- No income documentation required
- No work/training participation required
- No parent fee assessed

**To continue for full 12 months:**
- Must provide documentation of child's age and citizenship/legal immigration status within 3 months
- Parent must provide documentation of participation at any level in work, training, or education

**Definition of homelessness includes:**
- Sharing housing due to loss of housing or economic hardship
- Living in motels, hotels, shelters, cars, parks, abandoned buildings
- Awaiting foster care placement
- No fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence

No parent fee for the entire 12-month period if determined eligible.

## Q9: What types of unearned income are counted for eligibility?

**Answer:** Unearned income is income received outside of employment. Examples include:
- Merit-based scholarships
- Alimony payments
- Rental income

If you've received countable unearned income within the previous three months:
- Determine the frequency of the income
- Average accordingly to determine an average monthly amount

For example, if you received a merit-based scholarship during the previous 3-month period, the scholarship amount is averaged by 12 to determine a monthly amount to include in gross monthly income.

The gross monthly income calculation includes: average base monthly earnings + prorated bonuses/lump sums + monthly unearned income.

## Q10: What happens with temporary versus permanent income changes?

**Answer:** The distinction between temporary and permanent changes is important:

**Temporary Changes (3 months or less):**
- Do NOT affect eligibility for continuing Child Care Services
- Examples: seasonal coaching stipend, holiday employment, accrued vacation payout
- These should be annualized rather than averaged across the 3-month period

**Temporary Changes (longer than 3 months):**
- Must be evaluated to determine if new income exceeds 85% SMI
- Assessed against an annual time frame so calculated income reflects earnings for entire year
- Example formula: (Regular monthly income × 12) + (temporary assignment earnings × 4 months) ÷ 12 = new gross monthly income

**Permanent Changes:**
- Substantial and permanent increases must be reported if they would cause family to exceed 85% SMI
- Substantial and permanent decreases can result in reduced Parent Share of Cost

All income fluctuations considered when calculating income must be clearly explained in the child care case management system.
