## Q&A Pairs

**Q1: What tools do child care providers use for attendance tracking in the Texas child care system?**

**A1:** Child care providers use three main tools: KinderConnect (a website where parents/sponsors can view attendance records, update contact information, and download registration forms), KinderSign (a tablet application, sometimes called TX3C, used for recording attendance), and KinderSmart (a smartphone application). These integrated systems work together to track and manage child attendance for subsidized child care services.

**Q2: How do new parents or sponsors register for an account in the system?**

**A2:** New parents/sponsors register by going to https://childcare.twc.texas.gov/KinderConnect and creating a new account. During registration, they may encounter several error messages: if they see "Cannot match/Cannot uniquely identify," they should contact support for help; if they see "Cannot save operator data," they should check that their password meets requirements; "Access denied" means only the primary parent/sponsor can use KinderConnect; and "Account already exists" also requires contacting support.

---

**Q3: Can child care providers enter closure days, professional development days, or holidays into the attendance system?**

**A3:** No, providers do not need to take any action or enter these types of days into the system. Currently, providers are not required to input closure days, professional development days, or holidays into the attendance tracking system.

---

**Q4: How do parents or sponsors record attendance using KinderSign on the provider's tablet?**

**A4:** Parents/sponsors log into the child care provider's tablet using their phone number and their 4-digit PIN code. Once logged in, they can record check-in and check-out times for their children. It's important to note that once attendance has been recorded, it cannot be changed, and if the tablet is offline, attendance can still be recorded and will automatically update when the tablet reconnects to the internet.

---

**Q5: What should parents do if they need to correct attendance errors in the system?**

**A5:** Only parents/sponsors are allowed to correct attendance-related errors through KinderConnect. If KinderConnect shows attendance as incorrect, users should not worry because they only need one check-in or check-out time per day. They should simply enter the missing time, and if they have difficulty, they can click "all" at the top of the screen to view all attendance records and identify what needs to be corrected.

---

**Q6: What are the limitations for recording past attendance in the system?**

**A6:** Parents/sponsors can only record attendance for the previous 6 days. If they try to record attendance older than 6 days, the system will not allow it. Additionally, once attendance has been entered, it cannot be changed or modified, so it's important to enter the correct times when recording past attendance.

---

**Q7: How can providers check attendance records in the system, and what issues might they encounter?**

**A7:** Providers can view attendance by clicking on the Attendance page and then selecting Details in KinderConnect. Common issues include missing attendance information (which occurs when the tablet hasn't uploaded check-in/check-out information before the system automatically submits attendance—providers cannot submit this themselves), and disappearing attendance records (which providers cannot fix or review in the history and must request help from the Board for resolution).

---

**Q8: What happens if a tablet is offline when a parent tries to record attendance?**

**A8:** Parents/sponsors can still record attendance for their children even when the tablet is offline. The attendance information will be stored locally on the tablet and will automatically update and sync with the system once the tablet reconnects to the internet. This ensures that attendance tracking continues without interruption even during connectivity issues.

---

**Q9: What support resources are available for users who need help with the KinderConnect system?**

**A9:** KinderConnect support is available Monday through Friday from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM Central Time. Users can get help by calling 1-888-265-6461, sending an email to supportTX@kindersystems.com, or accessing online help at http://tx3c.info/. These resources are available to assist both parents/sponsors and providers with technical issues and questions about the attendance system.

---

**Q10: Why might attendance information be missing from KinderConnect, and who can resolve this issue?**

**A10:** Attendance information may be missing from KinderConnect if the tablet hasn't uploaded the check-in/check-out information before the system automatically submits attendance. In this situation, the provider cannot submit the attendance themselves. Additionally, if attendance records disappear, providers cannot fix this issue or review the history—they must request assistance from the Board to resolve the problem. This highlights the importance of ensuring tablets remain connected to the internet for regular syncing.
