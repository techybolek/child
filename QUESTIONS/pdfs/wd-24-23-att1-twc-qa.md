# Board Contract Year 2024 Income Eligibility Q&A
## WD Letter 24-23, Attachment 1

---

**Q1: What is the effective date range for the Board Contract Year 2024 Income Limit Eligibility Code Card for Child Care Services?**

A1: The income eligibility limits are effective from October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024. This document provides the income thresholds that determine eligibility for child care services during Board Contract Year 2024.

---

**Q2: What is the maximum income limit for CCDF-supported child care eligibility?**

A2: The maximum income limit for Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF)-supported child care is 85 percent of the State Median Income (SMI) for a family of the same size. Families with income exceeding this threshold are not eligible for CCDF-supported child care, regardless of other factors.

---

**Q3: How much can a family of four earn annually and still qualify for child care services at the 85% SMI threshold?**

A3: A family of four can earn up to $80,296 in gross annual income (or $6,691 in gross monthly income) and still qualify for CCDF-supported child care services at the 85% SMI threshold. This represents the maximum eligibility limit for this family size during the 2024 board contract year.

---

**Q4: What are the different income measurement standards used in the eligibility code card?**

A4: The eligibility code card uses two primary measurement standards: Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) at various percentages (100%, 150%, 175%, 185%, and 200%) and State Median Income (SMI) at various percentages (55%, 75%, 80%, and 85%). These different thresholds allow for tiered eligibility determinations based on family income and size.

---

**Q5: If a single-person household earns $3,000 per month, would they be eligible for CCDF-supported child care?**

A5: Yes, a single-person household earning $3,000 per month would be eligible for CCDF-supported child care. The monthly income of $3,000 falls below the 85% SMI threshold of $3,479 for a family size of one, making them eligible for services.

---

**Q6: What is the annual income limit for a family of six at 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines?**

A6: The annual income limit for a family of six at 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) is $80,560. However, families should note that this threshold may exceed the 85% SMI limit ($105,991 for a family of six), and the more restrictive threshold would apply for CCDF eligibility.

---

**Q7: Why do some cells in the income eligibility table show asterisks (*) instead of dollar amounts?**

A7: The asterisks (*) indicate that families at those income levels are not eligible for CCDF-supported child care because those income figures would exceed 85 percent of the State Median Income (SMI) for a family of the same size. The 85% SMI serves as the absolute ceiling for CCDF eligibility, regardless of FPG percentages.

---

**Q8: What are the source documents used to establish these income eligibility limits?**

A8: The income eligibility limits are based on two official sources: the US Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines published in the Federal Register (Vol. 88, No. 12) on January 19, 2023, and the US Department of Health and Human Services State Median Income Estimates from LIHEAP IM 2023-02, dated May 24, 2023, for FY 2024.

---

**Q9: How does the income eligibility change as family size increases from 1 to 15 members?**

A9: Income eligibility limits increase progressively with family size. For example, at 85% SMI, a single-person household can earn up to $41,754 annually, while a family of 15 can earn up to $127,671 annually. The incremental increases reflect the additional costs associated with supporting larger families while maintaining equitable access to child care services.

---

**Q10: Can a family of three with a monthly income of $5,500 qualify for child care assistance at any eligibility level?**

A10: Yes, a family of three with a monthly income of $5,500 can qualify for child care assistance. Their income falls below the 85% SMI threshold of $5,621 per month for a family of three, making them eligible for CCDF-supported child care services. They would fall between the 75% SMI ($4,959) and 80% SMI ($5,290) income brackets.
