# Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Subsidized Child Care Program - 87th Texas Legislature (2021)
## Question-Answer Pairs

### Q1: What percentage of TANF parents found employment within one year of receiving child care services in 2018?
**A1:** In 2018, approximately 86 percent of parents receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) found employment within 12 months of receiving child care. Additionally, approximately 86 percent of non-TANF parents maintained employment 12 months after receiving child care, and they experienced an average quarterly wage gain of $1,044, which would be $4,176 if annualized.

### Q2: How does the Texas Workforce Commission use subsidized child care as a work support service?
**A2:** TWC provides subsidized child care as a support service to help parents become and remain employed and contribute to the Texas economy. Making affordable child care available to parents addresses a common barrier to employment and enhances parents' ability to participate in workforce training activities. To receive subsidized child care, parents must be employed or participating in training or education activities leading to employment.

### Q3: What is the Texas Rising Star program and how has it grown since 2015?
**A3:** Texas Rising Star is a voluntary, quality-based rating system for Texas early childhood programs participating in TWC's subsidized child care program. It offers three levels of certification (2-Star, 3-Star, and 4-Star) to encourage providers to attain progressively higher certification requirements. Since 2015, the number of programs certified in Texas Rising Star has risen almost 65 percent. In 2020, Texas Rising Star programs had the licensed capacity to serve 457,525 children.

### Q4: What COVID-19 relief measures did TWC implement to support child care providers and families?
**A4:** TWC implemented multiple COVID-19 relief measures: (1) budgeted up to $100 million in CARES Act funds for emergency child care for essential workers, enrolling approximately 29,700 children; (2) authorized a temporary 25 percent increase in payment rates for providers serving subsidized children through December 2020; (3) implemented a Child Care Stabilization Grant program providing up to $10,000 (or $10,500 for Texas Rising Star programs) to help closed providers reopen; and (4) worked with the Texas Division of Emergency Management to help providers access critical cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment.

### Q5: What are the main reasons parents leave the subsidized child care program?
**A5:** From October 1, 2019, through September 30, 2020, the reasons for leaving care were: (1) Parent missed redetermination and/or did not return paperwork (43.0%); (2) Parent voluntarily withdrew from child care (19.9%); (3) Family is no longer eligible (12.5%); (4) Excessive absences (12.5%); (5) Permanent end of activities after three-month job search (10.3%); and (6) Other reasons (1.8%).

### Q6: How much funding did TWC transfer to TEA for early childhood education partnerships and scholarships?
**A6:** Rider 23 of the General Appropriations Act for the 86th Texas Legislature required TWC to transfer $500,000 in federal CCDF funds to TEA during Fiscal Year 2020 and FY'21 for early childhood education partnership projects and teacher stipends. Additionally, Rider 27 required TWC to dedicate $1.5 million over the 2020-21 fiscal biennium for scholarship programs that encourage increased participation in continuing professional development for early childhood professionals.

### Q7: What is the T.E.A.C.H. program and what results has it achieved?
**A7:** The T.E.A.C.H. (Teacher Education and Compensation Helps) program, operated by the Texas Association for the Education of Young Children (TXAEYC), provides scholarships for child care professionals to obtain CDA certificates, Certified Childcare Professional credentials, and associate's or bachelor's degrees in early childhood education. From BCY'16 through BCY'20, TXAEYC awarded 755 CDA assessment fee scholarships and 316 associate's degree scholarships. Recipients who attained a CDA or associate's degree saw wage increases averaging 7-10 percent in FY'18.

### Q8: How does TWC coordinate with TEA to track children receiving subsidized child care?
**A8:** HB 680 required TWC to coordinate with TEA to assign unique PEIMS (Public Education Information Management System) numbers to children younger than six who are enrolled in the child care subsidy program. This allows for longitudinal analysis of information on children who receive subsidies by bridging their participation in early childhood programs to their participation in public education. TWC collaborated with TEA to develop an automated interface and began assigning PEIMS numbers on September 1, 2020.

### Q9: What is the local match program and how much funding has it generated?
**A9:** The local match program allows Local Workforce Development Boards to leverage local public expenditures to draw down federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) matching funds. Boards work with public institutions of higher education, independent school districts, and local governments to certify local public expenditures for direct child care services and quality improvement activities. In BCY'19, Boards entered into 161 total agreements for $47 million in local match, which drew down $82.2 million in federal CCDF. In BCY'20, Boards entered into 154 total agreements for $45.3 million in local match, drawing down $82.7 million in federal CCDF.

### Q10: What benchmarks has TWC established for Texas Rising Star reimbursement rates?
**A10:** Beginning in BCY'19, Texas Rising Star rates for 4-Star providers were benchmarked at the 75th percentile of the Market Rate Survey, 3-Star providers receive 90 percent of the 4-Star rate, and 2-Star providers receive 90 percent of the 3-Star rate. Additionally, on October 6, 2020, the Commission established a minimum threshold requiring Boards to set their maximum reimbursement rate at or above the 30th percentile of the most recent Market Rate Survey to ensure equal access to child care services.

### Q11: How much funding does TWC provide for Texas Rising Star assessors and mentors?
**A11:** Texas Government Code §2308.3155(c) requires TWC to provide funding to Boards for Texas Rising Star assessors and mentors. Increases to the federal Child Care and Development Block Grant allowed TWC to increase support for Texas Rising Star staff from just over $3 million per year in FY'18 to almost $10.5 million per year in FY'21. As of September 30, 2020, there were 1,829 Texas Rising Star-certified child care providers serving approximately 43,788 TWC-subsidized children per day.

### Q12: What is the Texas School Ready (TSR) project and what tools does it provide?
**A12:** The Texas School Ready (TSR) project is supported by the Children's Learning Institute (CLI) using $11.7 million in federal CCDF funds transferred annually to TEA. TSR combines ongoing professional development, supplemental curriculums, and child progress monitoring tools for teachers from child care centers, Head Start, and public school pre-K programs. Tools made available at no cost through the online platform CLI Engage include the CIRCLE Progress Monitoring System, eCIRCLE Professional Development courses, the CIRCLE Activity Collection, and classroom observation tools.

### Q13: What quality improvement initiatives must Local Workforce Development Boards fund?
**A13:** Texas Government Code §2308.317(c) requires each Board to use at least 2 percent of its yearly child care allocation for quality initiatives, including: (1) quality child care programs receiving monitoring or seeking Texas Rising Star certification; (2) technical assistance for Texas Rising Star providers and consumer information for parents; (3) professional development for child care providers, directors, and employees; (4) educational materials for children served by child care providers; and (5) educational information for parents on the development of children under age five. In FY'20, Boards expended approximately $45 million on professional development activities.

### Q14: What is the Infant-Toddler Specialist Network and what does it provide?
**A14:** In March 2020, TWC awarded $3 million to the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston to establish a statewide Infant-Toddler Specialist Network (ITSN). This network provides teachers and administrators of infant and toddler programs with professional development, technical support, and opportunities to participate in professional learning communities (PLCs). The goal is to enhance the quality of care provided to infants and toddlers across the state and elevate the skills and competencies of teachers and administrators who participate.

### Q15: How did TWC gather stakeholder input for the 2022-2024 CCDF State Plan?
**A15:** As part of developing the CCDF State Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2024, TWC conducted a public survey in December 2020 to gather input on the plan and recommended strategies. As of December 10, 2020, TWC received 1,313 survey responses from child care and early learning providers (874), parents (300), state agency and Board staff (59), advocacy groups and community-based organizations (40), and other individuals in industry and workforce development (40). TWC also scheduled focus groups, solicited input from Boards and the Texas Early Learning Council, and planned to host a public meeting in April 2021 to invite feedback on the draft state plan prior to submission in June 2021.
