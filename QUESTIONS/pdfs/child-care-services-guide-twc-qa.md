# Child Care Services Guide - Q&A

## Eligibility Requirements

**Q1: What are the basic eligibility requirements for a child to receive Child Care Services (CCS)?**

A1: A child is eligible for CCS if they meet the following requirements: (1) The child is younger than 13 years of age, or is a child with disabilities and younger than 19 years of age; (2) The child is a U.S. citizen or legal immigrant; (3) The child resides with a family whose income does not exceed 85 percent of the state median income and whose assets do not exceed $1 million; and (4) The parents require child care to work, job search, or attend job training or an educational program.

**Q2: What is the waiting period for reapplying to CCS if my child's enrollment was terminated?**

A2: If your child's enrollment or your eligibility is terminated due to excessive unexplained absences or nonpayment of parent share of cost (copay), you are ineligible to reapply for CCS or be placed on the waiting list for 60 calendar days. However, this waiting period does not apply if you become a Choices participant requiring child care during that 60-day period.

**Q3: Is there a time limit for parents attending college while receiving child care assistance?**

A3: Yes, if a parent is enrolled full-time in a postsecondary undergraduate education program, child care services are limited to a cumulative total of 60 months. However, this limitation does not apply to parents who are both working and attending an educational program, or to parents enrolled in secondary education such as high school or GED programs.

**Q4: How long is my eligibility period once I'm approved for CCS?**

A4: Once approved for CCS, your eligibility period is 12 months from the start of care. Eligibility must not be redetermined sooner than 12 months following the initial start of child care or the most recent redetermination date. If your eligibility end date falls on a weekend or holiday, it is extended to the next working day.

## Income and Family Size

**Q5: What counts as family income when determining CCS eligibility?**

A5: Family income includes all gross income (before taxes) for each family member. However, certain income sources are excluded, including: SNAP benefits, Medicaid, housing assistance, educational scholarships and grants, tax refunds and credits, child support payments, unemployment compensation, SSI payments, foster care payments, and special military allowances like housing and subsistence allowances.

**Q6: How is family size determined for CCS eligibility?**

A6: A family is defined as two or more individuals related by blood, marriage, or court decree living in a single residence. This includes two married individuals (including common-law) and their household dependents, or a single parent and household dependents. A household dependent is an adult considered as a dependent for tax purposes, the child of a teen parent, or a child or minor in the household who is the responsibility of the parent.

**Q7: If I'm a teen parent, how is my income and family size determined?**

A7: For teen parents, family income is based solely on the teen parent's own income and the size of the teen parent's family (typically the teen parent and their child). The income of the teen's parents or guardians is not counted when determining the teen parent's eligibility for child care services.

**Q8: What documentation is required if someone other than the parent is caring for the child (in loco parentis)?**

A8: The caretaker must provide documentation verifying why the parent is unavailable (such as medical incapacitation, military deployment, or incarceration) and proof of their responsibility for the child. This typically includes a notarized power of attorney or sworn affidavit of temporary custody, plus documentation appropriate to the situation (military orders, incarceration verification, medical documentation, etc.).

## Work and Activity Requirements

**Q9: How many hours per week must I work or attend school to be eligible for child care assistance?**

A9: Single-parent families must work or attend job training/education for at least an average of 25 hours per week. Two-parent families must have a combined total of at least 50 hours per week. If you're engaged in a job search, you can also qualify if you're able to accept employment meeting these minimum requirements and are registered on WorkInTexas.com.

**Q10: How are education hours counted toward the work requirement?**

A10: Each credit hour of postsecondary undergraduate education counts as three hours per week. For condensed courses (such as summer semesters), each credit hour counts as six hours per week. Teen parents attending high school or equivalent are automatically considered to be meeting the weekly activity requirements.

**Q11: What happens if I lose my job or stop attending school during my 12-month eligibility period?**

A11: If you permanently lose your job or stop attending school/training, you may continue receiving child care for up to three months after reporting the change, as long as you are actively seeking employment or planning to resume training. During this three-month continuation period, you're expected to look for work or other qualifying activities. If you resume activities during this period, care continues without interruption.

**Q12: Can I temporarily suspend my child care services if I don't need them for a short period?**

A12: Yes, you may request to voluntarily suspend child care if you know you won't need it for a short period but want to retain your eligibility. Contact your local CCS office to learn about the specific policy for suspensions in your area, including how long services can be suspended and the process for reactivating them.

## Children Experiencing Homelessness

**Q13: How does CCS handle eligibility for families experiencing homelessness?**

A13: Families experiencing homelessness receive special accommodations. Self-attestation is accepted for initial eligibility, including proof of nighttime residence. The family's primary sleeping location at the time of eligibility determination is used to determine county of residence. Homeless families have three months to provide documentation of eligibility. Parents may self-attest to their residence by completing the residency questions in the TX3C Parent Central application.

**Q14: What address should I use on my CCS application if my family is experiencing homelessness?**

A14: Since families experiencing homelessness lack a permanent address, options include using the address of the workforce center, a homeless shelter, the child care provider (if the provider agrees), or a U.S. Postal Service "General Delivery" address if a post office offers that service in your area.

## Parent Share of Cost (Copay)

**Q15: What is the parent share of cost (copay) and how is it determined?**

A15: The parent share of cost is the amount families contribute toward their child care costs. It is calculated based on your family income and size. Higher income families pay a larger share of the cost. The copay must be paid directly to your child care provider. Your local CCS office will determine your specific copay amount when your eligibility is determined.

**Q16: What happens if my income decreases during my 12-month eligibility period?**

A16: If your income decreases, report it to your local CCS office. Staff will review your updated financial situation and may decrease your parent share of cost if appropriate based on your new circumstances. Contact them as soon as your income changes rather than waiting until you fall behind on payments.

**Q17: Can my child care provider charge me additional fees beyond my CCS copay?**

A17: This depends on your local CCS program's policy. Your local program will inform you whether providers are allowed to charge parents the difference between the CCS reimbursement rate and the provider's actual rate. A provider may only charge you this difference if the local CCS program permits it. Clarify this with both your local CCS office and your provider.

## Attendance Requirements

**Q18: How many absences are allowed during my child's 12-month eligibility period?**

A18: Children are allowed up to 40 unexplained absences during their 12-month eligibility period, and providers are still paid for these days. If a child exceeds 40 unexplained absences, child care services may be terminated before the eligibility period ends, and you may have to wait 60 calendar days before reapplying.

**Q19: What counts as an explained absence that doesn't count against the 40-absence limit?**

A19: Absences due to certain documented circumstances may be excluded from the 40-absence limit. These typically include absences for documented chronic illness, disability, or court-ordered visitation arrangements. Contact your local CCS office to understand what documentation is required for explained absences.

## Provider Requirements

**Q20: What types of child care providers can accept CCS children?**

A20: Eligible providers include licensed child care centers, licensed child care homes, registered child care homes, and certain relative providers who are listed with Child Care Regulation (CCR). Providers must meet specific requirements and pass background checks. The provider must agree to accept the CCS reimbursement rate and follow program requirements.

**Q21: Can a relative provide child care and receive CCS payment?**

A21: Yes, but only in limited circumstances. Relative providers must pass background and criminal history checks through the listing process with Child Care Regulation (CCR). They cannot be the child's parent or stepparent. Your local CCS office can provide detailed information about the specific requirements for relative care and guide you through the process.

**Q22: Can my child's parent be their child care provider and receive payment?**

A22: No, parents cannot serve as their own child's child care provider and receive CCS payment. This prohibition applies to both natural parents and stepparents. CCS is designed to help parents work or attend school by paying for care provided by someone else.

## Texas Rising Star and Provider Quality

**Q23: What is Texas Rising Star and how does it affect my child care options?**

A23: Texas Rising Star is a quality certification program for child care providers that identifies programs meeting higher standards than basic state licensing requirements. Providers can achieve 2-star, 3-star, or 4-star certification based on quality measures. Child care providers who have achieved Texas Rising Star certification may receive enhanced payment rates, and choosing a TRS provider means your child attends a program dedicated to higher quality care.

**Q24: Do providers receive different payment rates based on quality?**

A24: Yes, providers may receive enhanced payment rates based on several factors, including Texas Rising Star certification level, whether they serve children with disabilities (inclusion assistance rate), whether they provide transportation, and whether they offer care during nontraditional hours. Higher quality ratings generally result in higher payment rates.

## Transfers and Changes

**Q25: What changes must I report to my local CCS office during my eligibility period?**

A25: You must report the following changes within 14 calendar days: permanent loss of job or cessation of school/training activities; family income increasing above 85% of State Median Income; changes in family size; and changes to your address or contact information. There are specific forms on the TWC website for reporting changes.

**Q26: Can I transfer my child to a different provider?**

A26: Yes, you have the right to request a transfer to a different provider. If your current provider becomes ineligible to accept CCS children, your child will be transferred immediately. In most other cases, you must wait 2 weeks before the transfer can occur. Contact your local CCS office to initiate the transfer process.

## Fraud and Improper Payments

**Q27: What are the consequences of providing false information on my CCS application?**

A27: Providing false or inaccurate information can result in serious consequences. Your child care services may be terminated immediately, you may be prosecuted for fraud, and you could be required to repay all money for services you weren't entitled to receive. The 60-day waiting period for reapplication applies after fraud-related terminations.

**Q28: How are improper payments recovered from parents?**

A28: If improper payments are identified, parents may be required to repay child care benefits received improperly. Parents who owe recoupment amounts may be prohibited from future eligibility for child care services until the debt is repaid. The specific recovery process will be explained by your local CCS office.

## Appeals and Rights

**Q29: What are my rights if my child care services are terminated?**

A29: You have the right to receive at least 15 calendar days' notice before termination, and the notice must include the specific reason for ending services. You have 14 days from notification to file an appeal. In most cases, you have the right to continue child care during the appeal process, except if terminated due to excessive absences or unpaid parent share of cost. If the appeal is decided against you, you may be required to repay the cost of care provided during the appeal.

**Q30: Where can I find my local CCS office and get additional resources?**

A30: The CCS program is administered by local Workforce Development Board offices. You can find your local office by visiting https://www.twc.texas.gov/agency/workforce-development-boards.
