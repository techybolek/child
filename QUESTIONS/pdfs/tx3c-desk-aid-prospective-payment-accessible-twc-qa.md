## 2025 CCS Payment Schedule Questions

### Q1: How often are Child Care Services (CCS) payments issued in 2025?
**A1:** CCS payments are issued on a bi-weekly schedule throughout 2025. There are 24 payment periods in the year, with payments issued approximately every two weeks covering 14-day service periods.

### Q2: What is the payment date for services provided from January 27, 2025 to February 9, 2025?
**A2:** The payment for services provided from January 27, 2025 to February 9, 2025 is issued on January 30, 2025. Note that this is the issue date, and actual deposit to your account may take a few additional days depending on your financial institution.

### Q3: Does the payment issue date mean the funds will be immediately available in my bank account?
**A3:** No, the payment issue date is not the same as when funds become available in your account. The issue date is when the Boards issue the funds, but deposited funds may show within your account a few days after the issue date depending on your bank or financial institution.

### Q4: What service dates are covered by the payment issued on March 27, 2025?
**A4:** The payment issued on March 27, 2025 covers services provided from March 24, 2025 through April 6, 2025, which is a 14-day service period.

### Q5: When can I expect payment for child care services provided in mid-June 2025?
**A5:** For services provided from June 16, 2025 to June 29, 2025, the payment will be issued on June 18, 2025. For services from June 2, 2025 to June 15, 2025, the payment will be issued on June 5, 2025. Actual availability in your account will be a few days after these issue dates.

### Q6: What is the last payment period covered in the 2025 CCS Payment Schedule?

### Q7: How many days typically pass between the start of a service period and when payment is issued?
**A7:** Payments are typically issued just a few days after the service period begins. For example, the service period starting on 1/27/2025 has a payment issued on 1/30/2025, which is only 3 days later. This pattern of quick payment issuance continues throughout the year.

### Q8: If I provided services during the period of August 11-24, 2025, when should I expect the payment to be issued?
**A8:** For services provided from August 11, 2025 to August 24, 2025, the payment will be issued on August 13, 2025. Remember that the actual deposit to your account may occur a few days after this issue date.

### Q9: Why might there be a delay between the payment issue date and when I see the funds in my account?
**A9:** The delay occurs because the issue date is simply when the Boards release the funds for payment, not when your bank processes the deposit. The time it takes for funds to appear in your account depends on your specific bank or financial institution's processing times, which can vary.

### Q10: What is the payment schedule structure for the entire year 2025?
**A10:** The 2025 CCS payment schedule follows a consistent bi-weekly pattern with 24 payment periods throughout the year. Each payment covers a 14-day service period, and payments are issued shortly after the service period begins (typically within 2-3 days). The schedule runs from late January through late December, ensuring regular and predictable payment cycles for child care providers.
