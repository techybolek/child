## Q&A Pairs

**Q1: How do I create an online account to start using the TX3C attendance system?**

A1: To create your online account, go to https://childcare.twc.texas.gov/KinderConnect and follow the registration instructions. If you're unable to create an account, contact the support team at 1-888-265-6461 or email supportTX@kindersystems.com.

**Q2: What should I do each day to record my child's arrival and departure times at the child care center?**

A2: Use the tablet (KinderSign) located at your child care provider's location. Enter your phone number, and if it's your first time, create a PIN. After that, you'll sign in when dropping off your child and sign out when picking them up. If you need help signing in, ask your child care provider.

**Q3: What happens if the tablet doesn't have an Internet connection when I try to sign in or out?**

A3: You can still sign in/sign out as normal. The system will automatically update once the tablet reconnects to the Internet, so you don't need to worry about losing your attendance records.

**Q4: Can I record attendance for previous days if I forgot to sign in or out?**

A4: Yes, you can record attendance from past days, but only for the last 6 days. You'll need to use the computer at the center to do this, not the tablet.

**Q5: How do I report my child's absence when they are sick or won't be attending?**

A5: Download the KinderSmart app to your phone and scan the QR code from your KinderConnect account (on the website) to register the app. Then you can use the app to notify the center when your child will be absent. If you can't register the app, log into KinderConnect to find the QR code or contact support.

**Q6: What should I do if there's an incorrect date or time recorded in the system?**

A6: Talk to your child care provider. They have the ability to correct attendance records and fix any errors in dates or times.

**Q7: What does it mean if KinderConnect says the attendance information is incorrect?**

A7: This usually means you're missing either a sign-in OR a sign-out for the day. You only need ONE sign-in and ONE sign-out each day. Simply add whichever one is missing to complete the attendance record.

**Q8: What are the KinderConnect support hours and how can I contact them?**

A8: KinderConnect support is available Monday through Friday, 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM (Central Time). You can call 1-888-265-6461, email supportTX@kindersystems.com, or visit http://tx3c.info/ for online help.

**Q9: Who should I ask first if I have questions about signing in/out or attendance issues?**

A9: Ask your child care provider first. They can help you with most questions related to signing in/out and attendance, and they have the ability to make corrections if needed.

**Q10: If I can't change attendance information myself, what should I do?**

A10: Talk to your child care provider - they have the ability to fix attendance records. Parents cannot directly modify attendance after it's been recorded, but providers can make necessary corrections on your behalf.
