# Texas Early Childhood System Needs Assessment - Question & Answer Pairs

## Document Overview
This Q&A document is based on the "Early Childhood System Needs Assessment in Texas" prepared for the Texas Early Learning Council by researchers from UT Health Science Center at Houston and UT Austin, published November 2023.

Q1: How many children under age 5 live in Texas, and what does this mean for the state's early childhood system?
A1: Texas has over 1.8 million children younger than age 5, representing nearly one-third of the state's birth to 17-year-old child population. This population is larger than the total population of 10 other states. While Texas has a large early childhood system, it is not large enough to meet demand, requiring the state to be strategic and precise in responding to family needs so that limited resources go to communities that need them most.

Q2: What are the three main sectors that comprise Texas's early childhood system for the Preschool Development Grant?
A2: The three local family-serving sectors are: (1) the early learning and care sector, which includes center- and home-based child care, Head Start programs, public pre-K, and child care subsidies; (2) the early childhood intervention sector, which includes Early Childhood Intervention services and Early Childhood Special Education; and (3) the early childhood family support sector, which includes state and federally-funded home visiting models, parenting support, family-support education, and family resource centers.

Q3: Which five state agencies oversee Texas's early childhood system, and what are their primary roles?
A3: The five agencies are: (1) Texas Workforce Commission - serves as the Child Care Development Fund lead agency and oversees the Texas Rising Star quality rating system; (2) Texas Education Agency - oversees public pre-K and Early Childhood Special Education services; (3) Health and Human Services Commission - houses Early Childhood Intervention and Child Care Regulation; (4) Department of Family & Protective Services - administers federally funded home visiting programs and provides technical support for parent support programs; and (5) Department of State Health Services - provides technical support to local early childhood coalitions, particularly through the Help Me Grow framework.

Q4: How has the racial and ethnic composition of Texas's child population been changing?
A4: Texas's child demographics are shifting rapidly, with Hispanic children now being the majority of the early child population. Every racial and ethnic group is growing faster than non-Hispanic white children. Since 2013, the black child population percentage has increased by 8%, and the Asian child population percentage has increased by 32%. Additionally, Arabic is now the fifth most spoken language in the state, and there has been significant growth in South Asian populations (Indian and Pakistani), reflected in increased households speaking Hindi and Urdu.

Q5: What impact did COVID-19 have on child poverty rates in Texas compared to national trends?
A5: Texas experienced encouraging decreases in child poverty, with rates dropping 23% from 2015 to 2022. While nationally, 2021 marked an unprecedented decrease in child poverty due to COVID-era stimulus payments and earned income tax credit changes, Texas's decrease in 2021 aligned with the trend established since 2015. Notably, while child poverty increased nationally in 2022, Texas maintained its decreasing trend. Texas's child poverty rate, though among the highest in the nation, has shown consistent improvement.

Q6: What percentage of families in the needs assessment survey were able to access their preferred child care setting, and what factors influenced this?
A6: Fewer than 57% of families with annual incomes below $60,000 had concordance between their usual child care and their ideal child care, while more than 63% of upper-income families showed concordance. Notably, the 11% of respondents who utilized child care subsidies had a higher rate of being in their preferred child care setting. The data suggest that families need help navigating to their preferred child care option and affording it, with subsidies helping on both fronts.

Q7: What common stressors did families experience during the first two years of COVID-19 according to the survey?
A7: Very few families experienced none of the surveyed events. Nearly one-third of respondents lost a job or began a new job during this time, with only half of those who lost jobs indicating they began a new job. Nearly one-fifth experienced the death of a loved one. Nearly one-quarter indicated they are making less money now than before the pandemic. Families with a child with developmental delay or disability were more likely to experience loss of employment and had significantly more difficulty obtaining diapers or formula. Higher-income families were significantly more likely to report experiencing none of these events.

Q8: How does family quality of life differ based on income and whether families have a child with developmental delays or disabilities?
A8: Across all four domains of family quality of life (family interactions, external parenting support, emotional well-being, and material well-being), there were significant differences by income and disability status. Upper-income respondents had better family quality of life scores. Respondents with a child with developmental delay or disability and lower household income had significantly lower quality-of-life scores than even those at the same income level without a child with delays. Additionally, families who viewed COVID as negative for their children had significantly lower family quality of life scores regardless of income level or disability status.

Q9: What are the six key factors identified as important for retention and stability of the early childhood workforce?
A9: The six factors are: (1) healthy parent-professional relationships - how the workforce communicates and interacts with families; (2) child behavior management - capacity to address challenging behaviors; (3) job stress - including demands of the job and control over work; (4) pay, compensation, and incentives/stipends - system-level infrastructure supporting workers financially; (5) training and mentoring - ongoing professional development and peer support; and (6) supportive supervision - reflective supervision and administrative support that promotes wellness and problem-solving.

Q10: What challenges do early childhood providers face in discussing developmental concerns with parents, and what support do they need?
A10: Providers across all early childhood sectors except early intervention are uncomfortable discussing learning and developmental concerns and disciplinary strategies with parents. Over 60% of respondents in early intervention and early learning sectors wanted more training on dealing with challenging behaviors. Child care directors expressed that their staff's experience level is a hindrance to having these conversations and identified a need for more tailored training focused on inclusive practices, on-the-job skills, and practical ways to help children. Directors also emphasized wanting in-person and peer-to-peer training for professional skill development rather than just online requirement fulfillment.

Q11: How has COVID-19 impacted child behavior in early learning settings according to child care directors?
A11: Directors across all quality levels and education backgrounds reported seeing unprecedented increases in challenging behaviors. They described poor social-emotional skills, aggressive behaviors (throwing furniture, screaming, hitting), and difficulties with executive functioning (working in groups, changing tasks). Directors hypothesized this was due to children being kept at home and away from others longer than normal during COVID, increased screen time, and missing crucial developmental periods for socialization. Directors also reported increased numbers of children with potential developmental delays, particularly speech delays. These behavioral challenges were seen across all socioeconomic statuses and genders.

Q12: What role does trauma-informed practice and mindfulness training play in reducing workforce stress?
A12: Research findings showed that providers with higher trauma-informed attitudes reported significantly better job control, while those with higher intrapersonal mindfulness scores had significantly better ratings on job demands. Both trauma-informed attitudes and intrapersonal mindfulness were associated with better ratings on job fulfillment. These results indicate that training on trauma-informed practice and intrapersonal mindfulness may be a route toward reducing workplace stress among early childhood providers. In the family support sector, supervision that promotes mindfulness and self-care is associated with lower burnout and turnover.

Q13: What challenges exist in connecting families from early learning settings to early intervention services?
A13: There is great variability in directors' and owners' use of developmental screening, their understanding of what it is, and their knowledge about its benefits. Many centers use non-validated screening tools or express confusion about screening versus milestone tracking. Most directors indicated they simply do not know who to call or contact if they have a child needing developmental services, often defaulting to telling parents to contact their pediatrician. Children around age 3 face particular challenges during the transition between Early Childhood Intervention services and school-based services, with substantial confusion about which entity will assess and help the child. Assessment timelines vary dramatically across school districts, and many directors don't know how to access school-based services.

Q14: What are the capacity gaps in Texas's early childhood system?
A14: Across the entire early childhood system, services and programs do not have the capacity to meet the needs of families with young children. It's estimated that approximately 448,000 children receive free or subsidized care or education, but there are more than 475,000 children living below poverty, plus 431,000 children living between 100% and 200% of federal poverty level. Between 60,000 and 80,000 families were on the waitlist for child care subsidy every month in 2022 and 2023. Both Early Childhood Intervention and public school special education programs are operating past their funded capacity. The family support sector serves approximately 20,000 families but an estimated 321,000 children younger than age 5 live in ZIP codes prioritized for these services. There are 352 child care desert ZIP codes, with 52.5% in metropolitan core areas.

Q15: How do early childhood coalitions in Texas function, and what are their key strengths and weaknesses?
A15: Texas has strong trust and connections within early childhood coalitions, with most having mission statements, strategic plans, and paid staff. However, weaknesses include: relatively low use of by-laws or charters outlining membership expectations; centralized leadership with typically one organization leading execution while others advise; limited resource sharing beyond expertise and feedback; and needs for better data integration to track families moving between services. Coalition members identified needs for increasing member investment, developing shared leadership, obtaining evaluation support, and receiving technical assistance on innovation diffusion across member organizations. Most coalitions range from 20 to over 90 member organizations and are working to better include family voice through advisory boards and surveys.

Q16: What training and professional development needs were identified for the early childhood workforce?
A16: The workforce expressed strong preferences for in-person and peer-to-peer training for professional skill development rather than only online training for requirement fulfillment. Specific needs include: training on having difficult conversations with parents; specialized training on inclusive practices for neurodiverse children; just-in-time training on challenging behaviors; mentoring models for new staff; cross-center shadowing opportunities; cost-effective pre-service training (currently costs around $162 through Texas A&M AgriLife Extension); and business development training for small centers and home-based providers wanting to expand. Directors emphasized that existing online training fulfills requirements but doesn't provide the tailored, practical skills they need.

Q17: How does reflective supervision contribute to workforce retention and what is its current adoption in Texas?
A17: Reflective supervision, characterized by openness, collaborative problem-solving, mutual respect, realistic expectations, and encouragement of continuous learning, has been shown to be valuable for workforce retention. In the family support sector, where supervisors have received training in reflective supervision, home visitors reported it helped address feelings of being overwhelmed, sad, or burned out, created space to discuss difficult situations, built supportive work environments, and helped create healthier work-home boundaries. However, across all sectors, survey and interview data reflect large variations in who is using these practices across the state, indicating that more can be done to encourage and provide training on reflective supervision as a route to prevent turnover and burnout evident in all early learning sectors.

Q18: What are the main barriers to data integration in Texas's early childhood system?
A18: Data integration faces multiple barriers: the system spans five different state agencies with different data governance structures and siloed data systems within each agency; federal and state laws protect individual-level data from disclosure; data-matching projects can take years to set up and complete, diminishing the impact of results. At the local level, cross-organization data integration faces an exponential problem (5 organizations sharing data requires 25 data use agreements; 10 organizations requires 100). Centralized referral systems address some issues but create data collection burdens by requiring staff to switch between multiple systems. The timing needs also differ: local organizations need real-time data integration to track families through referral routes, while state-level needs can be quarterly or annual.

Q19: What findings emerged about pay and compensation in the early childhood workforce?
A19: Pay levels vary dramatically across the entire system, ranging from minimum wage to well over $100,000 per year based on required degrees and positions. Inequities exist not only across sectors but also between organizations and regions providing the same services, arising from local market pressures and individual organizational efforts. Some organizations have restructured costs to provide raises (one example: raising pay from $10-12/hour to $15-17/hour with corresponding 15-20% tuition increases). Relief funding from stimulus programs was cited as a major factor in retaining staff. The unique cycle in early learning settings creates additional challenges: losing teachers can force classroom closures, reducing revenue and preventing reopening, creating a vicious cycle many centers face post-COVID.

Q20: What did parents identify as the most important needs for their children following the COVID-19 pandemic?
A20: Three major themes emerged from parent responses: (1) Social-emotional catch-up - parents described children rarely being around peers, struggling with potty training and learning to share, having difficulty socializing with friends, and being reluctant to express emotions or needs to adults; (2) Accommodations - families with children with delays or disabilities discussed needing inclusive child care for neurodiverse children, while others emphasized the need for caregivers who understand the world children are growing up in and can have grace for children trying to understand it; (3) Stability and consistency - expressed in terms of child care provider turnover disrupting children's progress, needing consistent routines, and wanting more stable general interactions. Many parents expressed frustration with provider turnover even when centers pay better than others in their area.
