# Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Subsidized Child Care Report - 86th Texas Legislature (2019)
## Question-Answer Pairs

### Q1: What is the primary purpose of TWC's subsidized child care program?
**A1:** The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) provides subsidized child care as a support service to help parents become and remain employed and contribute to the Texas economy. The program promotes long-term self-sufficiency by enabling parents to work or attend education or training activities. To receive subsidized child care, parents must be employed or participating in training or education activities leading to employment.

### Q2: What are the main sources of funding for TWC's child care services?
**A2:** Child Care Services are funded through the federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Child Care. TWC is the lead agency for CCDF in Texas. In February 2018, the federal Bipartisan Budget Act provided a historic increase of $229.9 million in additional CCDF funds to Texas, the single largest federal allocation increase in the history of the Texas CCDF program.

### Q3: What information is TWC required to compile about parents receiving both TANF and subsidized child care?
**A3:** According to Texas Labor Code §302.0043(a)(1), TWC must compile information on whether parents receiving both Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and subsidized child care: (a) find employment, and (b) maintain the employment after one year. This helps evaluate the effectiveness of child care as a work support service for TANF recipients.

### Q4: How successful were TANF parents in finding and maintaining employment in 2016?
**A4:** In 2016, approximately 84.55% of TANF parents found employment within the year of receiving child care, and 65.12% maintained employment after one year. These rates show improvement from 2012, when 81.46% found employment and 58.93% maintained it after one year, demonstrating the program's effectiveness in supporting TANF recipients' employment stability.

### Q5: What were the employment outcomes for non-TANF parents receiving subsidized child care?
**A5:** For non-TANF working parents in 2016, approximately 79.21% maintained employment one year after entering child care, and they experienced an average quarterly wage gain of $471.57 (or $1,886 annually). This represents a positive trend in employment retention, though the wage gains decreased from earlier years when they peaked at $700.50 per quarter in 2013.

### Q6: What are the most common reasons children leave the TWC-subsidized child care program?
**A6:** From October 2017 through September 2018, the most common reasons children left the program were: parents missing redetermination and/or not returning paperwork (45%), parent voluntarily withdrawing from child care (20%), permanent end of activities after three-month job search (15%), excessive absences (13%), family no longer eligible due to income (3%), and other reasons (1%).

### Q7: What is Texas Rising Star (TRS) and what role does it play in the child care program?
**A7:** Texas Rising Star (TRS) is a quality rating and improvement system for child care providers in Texas. TWC focuses on expanding TRS quality care, with providers able to achieve 2-star, 3-star, or 4-star certification levels. As of September 30, 2018, there were 1,370 TRS-certified child care providers serving approximately 30,850 TWC-subsidized children per day. The program includes rate increases for TRS providers to incentivize quality care.

### Q8: How much are Local Workforce Development Boards required to allocate for quality initiatives?
**A8:** Texas Government Code §2308.317(c) requires each Local Workforce Development Board to use at least 2 percent of its yearly child care allocation for quality initiatives. These funds must be used for quality child care programs, technical assistance, professional development for child care providers, educational materials for children, and educational information for parents. Priority must be given to initiatives benefiting facilities working toward TRS certification or higher TRS levels.

### Q9: What is the T.E.A.C.H. program and what outcomes has it achieved?
**A9:** TWC awarded $1 million to the Texas Association for the Education of Young Children (TXAEYC) for the T.E.A.C.H. program, which provides scholarships for Child Development Associate (CDA) certificates, Certified Childcare Professional (CCP) credentials, and associate's degrees in early childhood education. As of November 2018, this resulted in 409 CDA Assessment Fee Scholarships, 106 Associate Degree Scholarships, 349 earned CDA credentials, 10 earned associate's degrees, and an average wage increase of 7-10% for recipients.

### Q10: In FY'18, how did TWC leverage local funds to expand child care services?
**A10:** Boards leverage local public expenditures to draw down federal CCDF matching funds by working with public institutions of higher education, independent school districts, and local governments. In FY'18, Boards entered into 142 agreements with colleges and universities that certified approximately $32 million in child care and early education professional development expenses, drawing down $91 million in federal CCDF matching funds. Additionally, 71 local agreements with ISDs contributed approximately $12.8 million in local funds, drawing down $24.6 million in federal CCDF funds.

### Q11: What percentage of parents who left child care in 2016 returned to TANF within one year?
**A11:** In 2016, 9.56% of parents whose children left TWC-subsidized child care received TANF within 12 months of leaving the program. This represents a declining trend from 2012 when 12.00% returned to TANF, indicating that the child care program is increasingly effective at helping parents maintain self-sufficiency after leaving the program.

### Q12: What initiatives did TWC approve with the additional $229.9 million in federal CCDF funds?
**A12:** TWC allocated $189 million for Direct Child Care Services with rate increases focused on TRS quality care, serving an estimated 28,000 additional children per day in FY 2019.

These responsibilities include licensing and registration of providers, monitoring and follow-up to ensure compliance with requirements, and investigating potential violations. HHSC works collaboratively with TWC through various interagency workgroups and initiatives.

### Q25: What is the ECDataWorks project and what will it produce?
**A25:** ECDataWorks is a multiyear project supported by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and facilitated by the University of Pennsylvania's Consortium for Policy Research in Education (CPRE). Beginning in early 2018, TWC partnered with TEA to participate in this project, which works collaboratively to conceptualize and develop tools to facilitate the organization, delivery, and strategic use of existing early childhood data. The initial web-based analytic tool—Texas Ready Communities, Ready Schools, and Ready Students (TXR3)—was being developed for release in 2019 to help decision-makers visualize how well prekindergarten, kindergarten, and TRS schools and communities are prepared to educate children.

### Q26: What is the Teaching Strategies GOLD assessment system and how is it being used in Texas?
**A26:** Teaching Strategies GOLD is an observation-based assessment system that enables early childhood caregivers to assess the development and learning of children from birth to five years of age. Through a collaborative project between TWC and TXAEYC, $750,000 was approved for a two-year term to implement this statewide early childhood assessment project. Teaching Strategies provides GOLD at no cost to providers that serve subsidized children, trains caregivers to use the assessment tools, and helps them use data to offer individualized care and instruction according to each child's strengths and needs. As of the report, 91 programs participated, resulting in 6,965 GOLD child portfolios.

### Q27: What were the findings regarding wage gains for non-TANF parents over the five-year reporting period?
**A27:** Non-TANF parents who maintained employment showed varying wage gains over the five-year period. Quarterly wage gains peaked in 2013 at $700.50 and declined to $471.57 by 2016. However, employment retention rates consistently improved, rising from 74.26% in 2012 to 79.21% in 2016. While wage gains decreased, the trend shows increasing employment stability, with the 2016 quarterly gain of $471.57 equaling approximately $1,886 in annual wage increases.

### Q28: What is the Strengthening Texas Rising Star Implementation project?
**A28:** In 2017, the Children's Learning Institute began a research-based project to strengthen TRS implementation, ensure equitable distribution of quality ratings and enhanced reimbursement rates, and provide accurate assessments of quality for families and stakeholders. Project activities include: analyzing the validity and reliability of the TRS assessment instrument; developing and implementing a certification program for TRS assessors and mentors, including a competency-based microcredential; and delivering specialized technical assistance (such as remote coaching) to improve providers' TRS ratings. Data collection was scheduled to finish in February 2019 with a full report to follow.

### Q29: How does TWC address infant and toddler care quality improvement?
**A29:** TWC approved $800,000 in FY'17 for a two-year term to TEA/CLI to improve the quality of infant and toddler care and assist providers with developmental screenings. Web-based training modules were developed focusing on early learning guidelines, social and emotional skills, and cognitive development. The modules provide lessons promoting child development across all domains and include developmental checklists for screening developmental delays against important milestones. Additionally, $2 million in Infant and Toddler Collaborative Matching Grants were allocated to work with stakeholders on developing infant and toddler focused efforts for TRS providers.

### Q30: What is the significance of the report's conclusion about subsidized child care as a work support service?
**A30:** The report demonstrates that subsidized child care is an effective work support service enabling parents to participate in the workforce or work-related activities. In 2016, approximately 85% of TANF parents found employment within 12 months of receiving child care, and approximately 79% of non-TANF parents maintained employment 12 months after receiving child care with an average annual wage gain of $2,324. The availability of stable and affordable child care is often a determining factor in parents' ability to obtain and retain employment, while also promoting the growth and development of tomorrow's workforce. TWC strives to build upon these successes by using outcome data and analyses to improve service delivery to Texas' working families.
