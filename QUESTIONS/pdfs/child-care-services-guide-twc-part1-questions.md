## Q2: How is the parent share of cost calculated?

**A:** The parent share of cost (PSoC) is calculated using a sliding fee scale based on family size and gross monthly income:

- For **one child in care**: PSoC starts at a minimum of 2% of family gross income for families at 1% of the state median income level, gradually increasing to a maximum of 7% for families at 76-85% of the state median income
- For **each additional child**: PSoC is calculated by gradual percentage increase with a limit of 7% of family gross income
- The PSoC is calculated **weekly** to ensure correct prospective payments

**Important:** The PSoC cannot increase during the 12-month eligibility period except when adding a child to care. Parents may receive reductions if income decreases or family size changes.

## Q3: Do I have to pay the parent share of cost if I'm experiencing homelessness?

**A:** No. Parents meeting certain criteria are **exempt from paying the parent share of cost** for the duration of the 12-month eligibility period, including:

- Parents participating in Choices or Choices child care
- Parents participating in SNAP Employment & Training
- **Parents of a child receiving Child Care for Children Experiencing Homelessness**
- Parents with children receiving protective services child care (unless DFPS assesses a PSoC)

## Q4: What are Texas Rising Star providers and do they get higher payment rates?

**A:** Texas Rising Star is a quality-based rating system for child care providers participating in TWC-subsidized child care. Providers are categorized as:
- Entry Level-designated
- Two-Star-certified
- Three-Star-certified
- Four-Star-certified

**Enhanced Payment Rates:**
Boards must establish higher payment rates for Texas Rising Star providers:
- **Two-Star providers** (also TSR participants): At least 5% greater than standard rate
- **Three-Star providers**: At least 7% greater than standard rate
- **Four-Star providers**: At least 9% greater than standard rate

These enhanced rates apply to **all age groups** and must not exceed the provider's published rate.

## Q5: What is the inclusion assistance rate for children with disabilities?

**A:** Providers caring for children with disabilities may receive payment of **up to 190% of the standard provider payment rate** for that child's age if they need additional staff or equipment.

**Eligibility Requirements:**
The child must be enrolled in or receiving benefits from:
- Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
- Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)
- Texas HHSC's Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) program
- Head Start program (identified as having a disability)
- Public school special education services

**Certification:** A qualified professional familiar with assessing the needs of children with disabilities must certify the need for the higher rate, considering costs of additional staff, equipment, training, and minor renovations.

## Q6: How does the waiting list work for child care services?

**A:** The waiting list is for parents who need and have applied for child care services:

**Three-Month Contact Requirement:**
- Parents on the waiting list are contacted every 3 months (90 days) to confirm they still need care
- The child care case management system (TX3C) automatically generates messages to parents
- If parents respond they still need care, they remain on the list
- **Children are removed if:** the parent says services are no longer needed OR doesn't respond within 10 business days

**Exemptions:**
- Children referred directly by recognized Pre-K or Head Start/Early Head Start partnerships are exempt from the waiting list (subject to funding and slot availability)

**Note:** Removal due to failure to respond is not subject to appeal.

## Q7: Do Workforce Boards need to coordinate with schools and Head Start programs?

**A:** Yes. Boards **must** coordinate with school districts, Head Start, and Early Head Start programs to ensure full-day, full-year child care is available to meet the needs of low-income parents working or attending job training/educational programs.

**Coordination Requirements:**
- Provide contact information to applicants for child care resource and referral agencies
- Allow children eligible for CCS to receive services while enrolled in Head Start or after-school programs
- Explore local match opportunities through school and Head Start programs
- **Annually inform** local school districts and open enrollment charter schools about opportunities to partner with child care providers to expand pre-kindergarten programs

**Additional Activities May Include:**
- Sharing facilities and staff across programs
- Coordinating transportation
- Cooperative staff training and professional development
- Developing collaborative eligibility determination systems

## Q8: Are teen parents treated differently for child care eligibility?

**A:** Teen parents (individuals 18 years or younger, or 19 years old and attending high school) have specific provisions:

**Family Size and Income:**
For teen parents, the parent share of cost is based **solely on the teen parent's income and family size**. The teen parent's family includes:
- The teen parent
- The teen parent's child(ren)
- Any household dependents

**Priority Status:**
Children of teen parents are in the **second priority group** (subject to availability of funds), specifically listed as priority #6 after:
- Children needing protective services
- Children of qualified veterans/spouses
- Children of foster youth
- Children experiencing homelessness
- Children of parents on military deployment

**Parent Share of Cost:**
Teen parents not covered under exemptions (Choices, SNAP E&T, homelessness, or protective services) must still be assessed a parent share of cost based on their own income.

---

## Q9: Can my child care services be terminated if I fail to pay the parent share of cost?

**A:** Yes, but Boards must follow specific procedures:

**Before Termination:**
Boards must establish a policy that includes:
- **Evaluation of financial situation** for extenuating circumstances affecting affordability
- **Offer of temporary PSoC reduction** if extenuating circumstances warrant it
- Documentation of the evaluation and any temporary reduction granted
- Process to identify circumstances that may jeopardize family self-sufficiency
- Maintenance of a list of all terminations due to PSoC non-payment

**Voluntary Transfers:**
Boards may prohibit parents from transferring providers if they owe PSoC to their current provider (except for health and safety concerns).

**After Termination:**
- If the Board pays the provider for unpaid PSoC, parents must repay the Board
- Parents are prohibited from future child care eligibility until repayment is made (unless they're Choices or SNAP E&T participants)
- This prohibition follows the parent even if they move to a different workforce area

---

## Q10: What are the Board's general responsibilities for child care services?

**A:** Workforce Development Boards have several key responsibilities:
