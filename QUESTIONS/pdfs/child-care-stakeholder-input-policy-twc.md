## Q10: What was the original recommendation from the Sunset Advisory Commission that led to this policy?

**Answer:** In January 2015, the Sunset Advisory Commission Staff Report recommended that the Texas legislature require TWC to develop a policy on gathering and using stakeholder input regarding the Child Care program. The Sunset Report stated that TWC should define appropriate methods for obtaining input through both formal means (such as advisory committees) and less formal means (such as time-limited workgroups, periodic surveys, and proactive communication through TWC's website). The goal was to ensure a consistent approach to gathering input and provide opportunities for advocates, child care experts, and providers to share information useful for program and policy improvement.
