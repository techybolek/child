## Question 1
**Q: How long does it take to find out if I'm eligible for Child Care Services?**

**A:** You will receive notification about your eligibility within 20 calendar days from when the CCS office receives all your required documents. This timeline applies whether you're applying for the first time, reapplying, or recertifying your eligibility.

## Question 2
**Q: Can my child care provider report my child's attendance for me?**

**A:** No, your child care provider cannot report your child's attendance on your behalf. You must not share your attendance system login information with your provider. However, you can designate others as "sponsors" (such as relatives, babysitters, neighbors, or carpool parents) to report attendance. Your child care provider can add these sponsors to your account, but sponsors must be at least 16 years old unless they are the parent.

## Question 3
**Q: What happens if my child misses too many days of child care?**

**A:** TWC policy allows up to 40 absences without penalty during your 12-month eligibility period. If your child accumulates more than 40 absences:
- Child care services may be terminated before the eligibility period ends
- The child won't be eligible for continued care at the next eligibility determination
- You cannot reapply for services for at least 60 calendar days from the termination date

Note: Absences due to documented chronic illness, disability, or court-ordered visitation are not counted toward this limit.

## Question 4
**Q: What changes do I need to report to my CCS office, and how quickly?**

**A:** You must report the following changes within 14 calendar days:
- Permanently losing your job or stopping school/training
- Family income increasing above 85% of the State Median Income for your family size
- Changes in family size
- Moving or changing contact information

Failure to report these changes could affect your eligibility.

## Question 5
**Q: Can I use a relative to provide child care through the CCS program?**

**A:** Yes, but only in limited circumstances. Relatives providing care must pass background and criminal history checks through the listing process with Child Care Regulation (CCR). Your local CCS office can provide more information about the specific requirements for relative care and the process for getting listed with CCR.

## Question 6
**Q: Can my child care provider charge me extra fees beyond my copay?**

**A:** It depends on your local CCS program's policy. Providers may only charge you the difference between the CCS rate and their regular rate if the local CCS program permits them to do so. Your local CCS office will inform you whether providers are allowed to charge this difference in your area.

---

## Question 7
**Q: What if my income drops and I can't afford my copay anymore?**

**A:** If your income decreases, contact your local CCS office immediately. CCS staff will review your situation and may decrease your parent share of cost (copay) if appropriate based on your new financial circumstances.

---

## Question 8
**Q: Can I appeal if my CCS benefits are terminated?**

**A:** Yes, you have 14 days to appeal once you've been notified of termination. You have the right to continue your child care during the appeal, except if your case was terminated due to excessive absences or unpaid parent share of cost. However, if the appeal is decided against you, you will have to repay the cost of child care provided during the appeal period.

## Question 9
**Q: How do I transfer my child to a different child care provider?**

**A:** You have the right to request a transfer from one provider to another. If your child must transfer because your provider is no longer eligible to accept CCS children, the transfer will be immediate. In most other cases, you'll need to wait 2 weeks before your child can transfer. Contact your local CCS office to understand the complete transfer policy.

---

## Question 10
**Q: What should I do if I lose my job while receiving CCS benefits?**

**A:** Report the job loss to your local CCS office within 14 calendar days. They can help connect you to services available through your local Workforce Solutions Office to help you find another job or access job training. This ensures you get the support you need while maintaining your child care services according to program guidelines.
