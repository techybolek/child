# Child Care Services Parent Rights & Responsibilities - Q&A

## Eligibility and Application

**Q1: How long does it take to find out if I'm eligible for Child Care Services?**

A1: You will receive notification about your eligibility within 20 calendar days from when TWC receives all your required documents. This timeframe applies whether you are applying for the first time, reapplying, or recertifying your eligibility for the CCS program.

**Q2: What are the consequences of providing false information on my CCS application?**

A2: Providing false or inaccurate information can result in serious consequences. Your child care services may be terminated immediately, and you may be prosecuted for fraud. Additionally, you could be required to repay all money for services you weren't entitled to receive. It's critical to provide accurate and truthful information on all application materials.

**Q3: Can someone help me complete my Child Care Services application?**

A3: Yes, you are allowed to have someone help or represent you when applying for CCS. The CCS scholarship application includes a section where you can indicate who assisted you with completing the application. This ensures transparency in the application process.

## Privacy and Provider Selection

**Q4: Is my application information kept confidential, and who can access it?**

A4: The information you share to determine your eligibility is confidential. However, it will be shared when needed to verify eligibility for services. TWC may also share your information with partner organizations to connect you to the best public services to meet your family's needs. This sharing is done to ensure you receive comprehensive support.

**Q5: How do I find and select a child care provider that accepts CCS?**

A5: You can research child care providers at https://childcare.twc.texas.gov/find/welcome. You have the right to visit providers before making a choice, and your local CCS office can help you in the selection process. After you're approved for CCS and have chosen a provider, you must complete the Provider Selection Form available on the TWC website to officially designate your provider.

## Attendance Requirements

**Q6: Who is allowed to report my child's attendance in the TWC attendance system?**

A6: You must report your child's attendance yourself - providers cannot report attendance on your behalf, and you must not share your login credentials with anyone, including your provider. However, you can designate additional "sponsors" (such as relatives, babysitters, neighbors, or carpool parents) to report attendance. Your provider can add these sponsors to your account. Note that no one under 16 can be designated as a sponsor unless they are the parent.

**Q7: What happens if my child exceeds the allowed number of absences?**

A7: Children are allowed up to 40 absences without penalty within a 12-month eligibility period, and providers are still paid for these days. If your child accumulates more than 40 absences, several consequences occur: child care services may be terminated before the eligibility period ends, the child won't be eligible for continued care at the next determination, and you cannot reapply for at least 60 calendar days from the termination date. Exceptions exist for absences due to documented chronic illness, disability, or court-ordered visitation.

**Q8: Can my child care provider record any attendance for my child?**

A8: In limited situations, yes. When you or your designated sponsor is not dropping off or picking up your child (such as when the provider is transporting your child to or from school), the provider may record either the check-in or check-out. However, you or your sponsor must still record at least one daily check-in or check-out for your child. The key is that at least one attendance action per day must come from you or your sponsor.

## Reporting Changes and Transfers

**Q9: What changes must I report to my local CCS office, and how quickly?**

A9: You must report the following changes within 14 calendar days: if you permanently lose your job or stop attending school or training; if your family income increases above 85% of the State Median Income for your family size; if your family size changes; and if you move or change your contact information. There are specific forms available on the TWC website for reporting changes depending on whether you're on the waiting list or already enrolled in CCS.

**Q10: What's the process for transferring my child to a different provider?**

A10: You have the right to request a transfer from one provider to another. If your provider is no longer eligible to accept CCS children, your child will be transferred immediately. In most other cases, you must wait 2 weeks before the transfer can occur. Contact your local CCS office to learn about the specific transfer policy and initiate the process.

## Costs and Financial Issues

**Q11: Can my child care provider charge me fees beyond my CCS copay?**

A11: This depends on your local CCS program's policy. Your local CCS program will inform you whether providers are allowed to charge parents the difference between the CCS reimbursement rate and the provider's actual rate. A provider may only charge you this difference if the local CCS program permits it. Be sure to clarify this with both your local CCS office and your provider.

**Q12: What should I do if my income drops and I can't afford my copay?**

A12: If your income decreases, reach out to your local CCS office immediately. CCS staff will review your updated financial situation and may decrease your parent share of cost (copay) if appropriate based on your new circumstances. Don't wait until you fall behind on payments - contact them as soon as your income changes.

## Termination and Appeals

**Q13: Under what circumstances can CCS end my child's eligibility before the 12-month redetermination date?**

A13: CCS can terminate your child's scholarship early for several reasons: if your child has been absent more than 40 days within the 12-month eligibility period; if you have not paid your parent share of cost (copay); if you are determined to have committed fraud; or if you move out of Texas. You must receive at least 15 calendar days' notice before termination, and the notice must include the specific reason for ending services.

**Q14: What are my rights if I want to appeal a CCS termination decision?**

A14: You have 14 days from notification to appeal a termination decision. You have the right to continue your child care during the appeal process, except if the case was terminated due to excessive absences or unpaid parent share of cost. However, if the appeal is decided against you, you will be required to repay the cost of child care provided during the appeal period, so consider this carefully before requesting continued services during appeal.

**Q15: How do I file a complaint about discrimination or poor service from my local CCS office?**

A15: You have the right to receive CCS regardless of race, color, national origin, age, sex, disability, political beliefs, or religion. If you experience discrimination, you can file a written complaint within 180 days from the date of the alleged discriminatory act. You can also file complaints about other service issues. Contact your local Equal Opportunity/Complaints officer at your Workforce Solutions office, which you can find at https://www.twc.texas.gov/agency/workforce-development-boards.

## Additional Services and Support

**Q16: If I lose my job while receiving CCS, what support is available to help me find new employment?**

A16: If you lose your job, report it immediately to your local CCS office. They can help connect you to services available through your local Workforce Solutions Office, which can assist you in finding another job or accessing job training programs. This support can help you maintain your eligibility for CCS while transitioning to new employment.

**Q17: Can I temporarily suspend my child care services if I don't need them for a short period?**

A17: Yes, you may request to temporarily suspend your child care if you know you won't need it for a short period but want to retain your eligibility. Your local CCS office will explain the specific policy for suspensions, including how long you can suspend services and the process for reactivating them when you're ready to resume care.

**Q18: What requirements apply if I want to use a relative as my child care provider?**

A18: CCS child care may be provided by a relative only in limited circumstances. Relatives providing care must pass background and criminal history checks through the listing process with Child Care Regulation (CCR). Your local CCS office can provide detailed information about the specific requirements for relative care and guide you through the process for getting your relative listed with CCR.

## Contact and Resources

**Q19: Where can I find contact information for my local CCS program and related resources?**

A19: The CCS program is administered by local Workforce Development Board offices. You can find your local office by visiting https://www.twc.texas.gov/agency/workforce-development-boards. For general questions, compliments, or complaints, you can call 800-628-5115. Language services, including interpretation and translation, are available free of charge upon request.

**Q20: What should I do if I suspect fraud in the Child Care Services program?**

A20: The Texas Workforce Commission takes fraud seriously to ensure child care funds are maximized for qualified families. If you suspect fraud in the CCS program, you should report it by calling the fraud hotline at 800-252-3642. All reports are investigated to protect program integrity and ensure resources go to eligible families.
