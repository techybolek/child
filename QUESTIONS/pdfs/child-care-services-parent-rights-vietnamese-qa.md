# Child Care Services Parent Rights - Vietnamese Version Q&A

## Question-Answer Pairs for Training and Chatbot Purposes

---

**Q1: How long does it take to find out if I'm eligible for Child Care Services (CCS) after submitting my application?**

A1: You will receive notification about your eligibility within 20 calendar days from when all of your documents are received. This timeline applies whether you are applying for the first time, reapplying, or requesting recertification of your eligibility status.

---

**Q2: What happens if I provide incorrect or false information on my CCS application?**

A2: Providing false information can result in termination of your child care services and may constitute fraud. You could be prosecuted for fraud and/or be required to repay funds for services you were not entitled to receive. This is taken seriously to ensure funds are available for eligible families.

---

**Q3: Am I required to use the attendance system at my child's care provider, and what happens if I encounter problems with it?**

A3: Yes, you must ensure your child attends regularly and use TWC's attendance system to record attendance and absences. If you experience any issues with the attendance system, you must report these problems to your local CCS office. Failure to report issues may result in your child being marked as absent, which could affect your benefits.

---

**Q4: Who is allowed to check in my child at the care provider - can the provider do it for me?**

A4: The child care provider cannot check in your child on your behalf, and you cannot share your attendance system login information with anyone else, including your provider. However, you can designate others as "sponsors" (such as relatives, caregivers, neighbors, or carpool parents) to handle attendance. Children under 16 cannot be sponsors unless they are the parent of the child.

---

**Q5: How many days can my child be absent before it affects our CCS benefits?**

A5: TWC policy allows your child to be absent up to 40 days within the 12-month eligibility period without penalty, and the provider will still be paid for these absences. However, if your child exceeds 40 absences, child care services may be terminated before the eligibility period ends, the child won't qualify for care in the next review, and you cannot reapply for at least 60 calendar days from the termination date. Absences due to chronic illness, disability, or court-ordered visitation are not counted.

---

**Q6: What changes am I required to report to my local CCS office, and how quickly must I report them?**

A6: You must report the following changes within 14 calendar days: permanent job loss or stopping school/training attendance; household income increases to over 85% of the State Median Income for your family size; changes in household size; and moving to a new address or changes to your contact information. Reporting these changes promptly helps maintain your eligibility and prevents issues.

---

**Q7: Can I use a relative to provide child care services under the CCS program, and what are the requirements?**

A7: In some limited cases, CCS child care can be provided by a relative. The relative providing care must pass background and criminal history checks through the registration process with Child Care Regulation (CCR). Your local CCS office can provide additional information about requirements for relative caregivers and the CCR registration process.

---

**Q8: Under what circumstances can my CCS benefits be terminated early, before my 12-month review date?**

A8: Your CCS scholarship can be terminated early if: your child is absent more than 40 days during the 12-month eligibility period; you haven't paid your parent portion (co-payment); you commit intentional fraud; or you move out of Texas. The local CCS office must notify you at least 15 calendar days before termination, and the notice must clearly state the reason for termination.

---

**Q9: Can I appeal if my CCS benefits are terminated, and will my child continue to receive care during the appeal?**

A9: Yes, after receiving notice that your CCS will be terminated, you have 15 days to appeal the decision. You have the right to continue receiving child care services during the appeal period, except when termination is due to excessive absences or non-payment of the parent portion. However, if the appeal decision is unfavorable to you, you will be required to repay the cost of child care received during the appeal period.

---

**Q10: What should I do if I want to file a complaint about CCS services or feel I've been discriminated against?**

A10: You have the right to receive CCS regardless of race, color, nationality, age, gender, disability status, political views, or religion. If you feel discriminated against, you can file a complaint within 180 days of the alleged discrimination. For complaints about services received from your local CCS office, you can file a complaint with the local Complaint/Equal Opportunity officer.
