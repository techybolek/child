# Questions and Answers: Child Care Services Guide (Part 2)

## Q1: Who can initiate the inclusion assistance rate process for a child?

**Answer:** The inclusion assistance rate process may only be initiated by a child's parent. It may not be initiated by child care providers. If a provider requests that a child receive the inclusion assistance rate, the provider must be informed that only the parent can request it. The provider should discuss their concerns about the child's special needs with the parent and may recommend that the parent contact the Board's child care contractor to discuss inclusion assistance rate benefits and process.

## Q2: How is a provider's published daily rate calculated?

**Answer:** A provider's published daily rate is the sum of calculated daily rates and calculated daily fees. The calculation method depends on the provider type:

- **Monthly rates:** Divide by 4.33, then divide by 5
- **Biweekly rates:** Divide by 2.165, then divide by 5
- **Weekly rates:** Divide by 5
- **Hourly rates:** Multiply by 12 for full-day rate, or by 6 for part-day rate

Daily fees include enrollment/registration fees, supply fees, and activity fees charged to all parents. The calculated daily fee amount is the total reported fees prorated by the number of days in the provider's program year.

## Q3: What payment methods must Boards use to pay child care providers?

**Answer:** Boards must pay child care providers using either Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or debit card payments. Boards may determine which method is most practical for their workforce area and can choose from:
- EFT and debit card
- EFT only
- Debit card only

In exceptional circumstances, Boards may determine that a check is required, but these exceptions must be documented with justification. Providers must be paid no later than 21 calendar days following the completion of the service delivery time frame.

**Answer:** TWC accepts three types of local match:

1. **Private Donations:** Funds from private entities donated without restrictions requiring use for a specific individual/organization or non-CCDF activities, that don't revert to the donor and aren't used to match other federal funds.

2. **Public Transfers:** Funds from public entities transferred without restrictions, not used to match other federal funds, and not federal funds unless authorized by law.

3. **Public Certifications:** Expenditures by public entities certifying that expenditures are for CCDF State Plan activities, not used to match other federal funds, and not federal funds unless authorized by law.

## Q5: What are the age requirements for a child to be eligible for child care services?

**Answer:** To be eligible for subsidized child care services, the child must be either:
- Younger than 13 years of age, OR
- A child with disabilities and younger than 19 years of age

This requirement must be met at the time of eligibility determination or redetermination. The exception is children receiving or needing protective services, which have different eligibility criteria.

## Q6: What is the income limit for families to qualify for child care services?

**Answer:** The family's income must not exceed 85 percent of the state median income (SMI) for a family of the same size. Additionally, the family's assets must not exceed $1 million as certified by a family member.

The income thresholds are updated annually, effective October 1 of each year, and TWC publishes the updated SMI data for determining eligibility. The calculation uses gross income before tax adjustments.

## Q7: How long is the waiting period if a parent is terminated for nonpayment of the Parent Share of Cost (PSoC)?

**Answer:** A parent is ineligible to reapply for child care services or to be placed on the waiting list for **60 calendar days** if the child's enrollment or parent's eligibility is terminated due to:
- Nonpayment of PSoC, OR
- Excessive unexplained absences

The Board must include this mandatory waiting period information in all termination documentation sent to the parent. The waiting period will not apply if the individual becomes a Choices participant who requires child care during the 60-day period.

## Q8: What documentation is needed to verify a child's citizenship status?

**Answer:** Boards must verify a child's U.S. citizenship or legal immigrant status using acceptable documentation. Primary verification documents include:

- Birth certificate (U.S. or its territories)
- Current U.S. passport
- Hospital or public health birth record (U.S. or its territories)
- Church or baptismal record (U.S. or its territories)
- TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, or other public assistance records

For immigrants, acceptable documents include:

- Form I-94/I-94a with appropriate annotations
- Certificate of U.S. Citizenship (N-561)
- Native American Tribal Document/Card (Form I-872)

Only the child's citizenship or immigration status needs to be documented, not the parents'. Photocopies are acceptable to expedite the process.

## Q10: How is average monthly family income calculated for eligibility determination?

**Answer:** For initial eligibility and redetermination, family income is calculated based on the average monthly family income for each family member. Board contractor staff must review:

- **Previous 3 months of income** for monthly pay periods, OR
- **Previous 12 weeks** for weekly or biweekly pay periods

If a family member has a **substantial change in earnings** during the most recent month (permanent change in full-time/part-time status, permanent wage change, or adding/ending employment), income should be calculated from when the change occurred rather than the full three months.

For families with **fluctuating income** (variable schedules, overtime, commissions, seasonal work), the fluctuations are calculated separately and averaged over the appropriate time period.

Three months is the preferred guideline, but Boards may use available documentation based on local procedures if three full months aren't available (e.g., for newly employed parents).
