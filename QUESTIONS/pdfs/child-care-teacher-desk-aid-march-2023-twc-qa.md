## Q&A Content

**Q1: How do I register on WorkInTexas.com to find a child care job?**

A1: To register on WorkInTexas.com, go to www.workintexas.com and select "sign in" or "register" in the top right corner. The registration process takes approximately 5-8 minutes to complete as an individual job seeker. If you've previously filed for unemployment benefits, you should already have a username and password. The site is also available in Spanish by clicking the "En Espanol" link.

**Q2: What are the main sections I need to complete during the WorkInTexas.com registration process?**

A2: During registration, you'll complete 7 sections through a wizard process: Education, Veteran status, Employment history, Farmworker status, Demographic information, Barriers to employment, and Public Assistance. All fields with a red asterisk (*) are required, and you must complete all pages to finish the registration. After completing the last page, you'll receive a confirmation message stating your application has been successfully completed.

**Q3: How long does it take to complete the Resume Builder Wizard on WorkInTexas.com?**

A3: The Resume Builder Wizard takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. You should select the "Comprehensive" option under the Resume Creation Method to build your resume from scratch using a step-by-step process. The wizard has 13 sections, though you can skip some sections. At minimum, it's recommended to complete Education, Certifications, Employment, Job Skills, Contact, and References sections.

**Q4: What should I include in my resume title when creating a child care resume?**

A4: Your resume title should reflect the specific field of work you are searching for, such as "Preschool Teacher" or "Child Care Teacher." This is important because the resume title is a searchable field by employers if you choose to make your resume accessible online, so including relevant keywords helps employers find your profile.

**Q5: What happens if I click "Exit Wizard" while creating my resume?**

A5: You should not use the Exit Wizard link unless you are completely finished working for that day. The Exit Wizard function will only save the previous pages and backwards; the current page you're on will NOT be saved. However, the Resume Wizard does automatically save information as you progress through each section by clicking "Next."

**Q6: How do I search for child care jobs on WorkInTexas.com?**

A6: Once signed in to www.workintexas.com, select "Individual Job Search" on the Quick Job Search Link in the left navigation menu. You can then expand additional quick search options and select any combination of search criteria. From the Occupation group list, click "Child Care Teacher" and then click Search to see available positions matching your criteria.

**Q7: What information should I check before applying for a job through WorkInTexas.com?**

A7: Before applying, click on "How to Apply" to see the Employer's Preference for application methods. Review all job details including job requirements, job properties, salary range, location, and work schedule. You must be a U.S. Citizen or have authorization to work in the United States. Make sure to read the complete job description by scrolling down to see all information about the position.

**Q8: What steps do I need to follow to submit a job application through WorkInTexas.com?**

A8: To submit an application, first choose the appropriate resume from the drop-down menu if you have more than one. Then check the acknowledgement checkbox to confirm you will be providing your contact information to the employer and that your information may be different from what's specified in the resume. Once all required items show green check marks and you've checked the acknowledgement box, click "Submit Application."

**Q9: What should I do at the end of the Resume Builder process regarding references?**

A9: As the last step of the Resume Builder, you should check the box entitled "Display References Available on Request" on your resume. After this, you should preview your resume to ensure everything looks correct, then click "Save Resume & Return" to complete the process.

**Q10: Where can I get additional help with finding a child care job or using WorkInTexas.com?**

A10: For further assistance, you can contact your local Workforce Development Board. You can find your local workforce development board by visiting: https://www.twc.texas.gov/partners/workforce-development-boards-websites.
