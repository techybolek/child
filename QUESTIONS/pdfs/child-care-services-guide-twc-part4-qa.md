# Questions and Answers: Child Care Services Guide TWC Part 4

## Q1: How long does child care eligibility last once I'm approved?

**A:** Once you're approved for child care services, you receive a 12-month eligibility period. During this time, your child will continue to receive services regardless of temporary changes in your income (as long as it doesn't exceed 85% of State Median Income) or temporary changes in your work, education, or job training status. Each child is guaranteed a minimum of 12 months of care.

## Q2: What counts as a "temporary change" in my work or school status?

**A:** Temporary changes include:
- Time-limited absences for family leave, parental leave, or sick leave
- Interruptions in work for seasonal workers between regular work seasons
- Student holidays or breaks during training or education programs
- Reduction in work, training, or education hours (as long as you're still participating)
- Other cessation of work or attendance that doesn't exceed three months (90 days)

You are NOT required to report these temporary changes, except for changes in residency.

## Q3: What happens if I permanently lose my job during my eligibility period?

**A:** If you experience a permanent cessation of work, education, or training, you must report this within 14 calendar days. However, your child care will continue for a minimum of three months (90 days) or until your scheduled redetermination (whichever comes first) to allow you time to resume participation in work, education, or training. You'll receive written notification at least 15 days before any termination of services.

## Q4: What is Former DFPS child care and how long does it last?

**A:** Former DFPS child care applies to children who were previously in protective services but whose DFPS General Protective Services cases have closed. These children must continue receiving child care through the end of their 12-month eligibility period using TWC-allocated funds. Each child served by DFPS is regarded as a "family of one," so each child must receive a full 12 months of services before transitioning to Low-Income child care eligibility determination.

## Q5: What are the attendance requirements for subsidized child care?

**A:** Your child must attend care on a regular basis consistent with their authorization. The attendance standards are:
- No more than 40 total unexplained absences in a 12-month eligibility period
- You'll receive written notices at 15 absences and 30 absences
- Absences due to documented chronic illness, disability, or court-ordered visitation are NOT counted
- You must report attendance daily using TWC's attendance reporting system
- Exceeding 40 unexplained absences may result in termination and a 60-day waiting period before reapplying

## Q6: Will my Parent Share of Cost increase during my 12-month eligibility period?

**A:** No, your Parent Share of Cost (PSoC) cannot increase during your 12-month eligibility period, even if your income increases (as long as it stays below 85% of State Median Income). However, if your income decreases or family size increases, your PSoC may be reduced if you report the change within 14 days. If you resume work after an activity interruption, your PSoC also will not increase above the initially assessed amount.

## Q7: Can I continue receiving child care if I move to a different workforce area in Texas?

**A:** Yes, continuity of care is maintained when you move between workforce areas within Texas. Your child will remain eligible and continue receiving services for the duration of the eligibility period. You won't need a new eligibility determination just because you moved. The receiving Board will work with you to locate an eligible provider, and all case changes will be completed in the child care case management system. Your PSoC cannot increase, but may decrease if appropriate.

## Q8: Can a relative provide care for my child, and what are the requirements?

**A:** Yes, relative child care providers are eligible if they are at least 18 years old and are your child's grandparent, great-grandparent, aunt, uncle, or sibling (who doesn't live in the same household). Relatives must list with Child Care Regulation (CCR) and undergo criminal background checks and central registry checks. In-home care by relatives is only allowed for children with disabilities, children under 18 months, children of teen parents, or when evening/overnight/weekend work schedules make taking the child out of the home disruptive.

## Q9: How quickly can I transfer my child to a different provider?

**A:** Normally, transfers are not permitted until the start of the second pay period following your request. However, transfers can happen sooner in these situations:
- The provider is subject to a Child Care Regulation corrective action
- The transfer is authorized by Child Protective Services
- On a case-by-case basis (for example, due to health and safety concerns)
- If your provider is on corrective or adverse action, the transfer won't count against you under the Board's transfer policy

## Q10: What are my appeal rights if my child care is denied or terminated?

**A:** You have the right to request a hearing if your eligibility or child's enrollment is denied, delayed, reduced, suspended, or terminated. You must:
- Receive written notification at least 15 calendar days before any denial or termination
- Be informed of your right to appeal in the notification
- May have another individual represent you during the appeal process
- If you request a hearing and your child is currently enrolled, care will continue during the appeal process (unless terminated for excessive absences or nonpayment of Parent Share of Cost)
- Note: Parents of children in protective services must follow DFPS procedures, not the Chapter 823 appeals process
