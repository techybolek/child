# Q&A: Evaluation of Effectiveness of Subsidized Child Care Program - Report to the 85th Texas Legislature

## Q1: What is the primary purpose of TWC's subsidized child care program?
**A1:** The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) provides subsidized child care as a support service to help parents become and remain employed and contribute to the Texas economy. Making affordable child care available to parents addresses a common barrier to employment and enhances their ability to participate in workforce training activities. To receive subsidized child care, parents must be employed or participating in training or education activities leading to employment.

## Q2: What information is TWC required to compile regarding parents receiving TANF and subsidized child care?
**A2:** For parents receiving both TANF and subsidized child care, Texas Labor Code §302.0043 directs TWC to report whether the parent: (A) finds employment, and (B) maintains the employment after one year. This evaluation helps measure the program's effectiveness in helping TANF recipients transition to and maintain employment.

## Q3: How did TANF parents perform in finding and maintaining employment in 2014?
**A3:** In 2014, 86.47% of TANF parents who received child care found employment within the year, and 64.20% maintained employment after one year. This shows a positive trend from 2010 when 76.16% found employment and 54.34% maintained it after one year, demonstrating consistent improvement in employment outcomes.

## Q4: What employment outcomes must TWC track for non-TANF parents receiving subsidized child care?
**A4:** For non-TANF working parents receiving TWC-subsidized child care, Texas Labor Code §302.0043(a)(2) directs TWC to report whether the parent: (A) maintains employment, and (B) experiences a change in earnings after one year of employment. This helps evaluate whether subsidized child care serves as an effective work support for working families.

## Q5: What were the wage gains for non-TANF parents receiving child care in 2014?
**A5:** In 2014, non-TANF parents receiving subsidized child care experienced an average quarterly wage gain of $477.15 after one year, with 87.30% maintaining their employment. While this represents a decrease from 2010's wage gain of $571.71, it shows that subsidized child care helps working parents maintain stable employment with modest income growth.

## Q6: What are the most common reasons children leave the TWC-subsidized child care program?
**A6:** From October 2015 through September 2016, the top three reasons children left child care were: (1) Parent voluntarily withdrew from child care (24.30%), (2) Parent missed redetermination and/or did not return paperwork (23.78%), and (3) Parent is no longer meeting work, training, or education requirements (12.47%). These reasons account for approximately 60% of all program exits.

## Q7: How does TWC collaborate with other state agencies to improve child care quality?
**A7:** Beginning in 2014, TWC initiated regularly scheduled quarterly conference calls with the TEA Office of Early Childhood Education, DFPS Child Care Licensing, and the Head Start Collaboration Office (which includes the Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System). The goal of these calls is to improve collaboration efforts among agencies directly involved in child care and early childhood education by sharing information about initiatives, goals, and discussing opportunities for collaboration.

## Q8: What professional development initiatives did TWC fund to improve early childhood education quality?
**A8:** TWC awarded $1 million to the Texas Association for the Education of Young Children (TAEYC) to provide scholarships for child care professionals. As of November 2016, 141 CDA and/or CCP scholarships were awarded, 54 associate's degree scholarships were awarded, and 85 caregivers obtained a CDA credential. Additionally, TWC partners with DFPS and Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Services to provide online training courses on health and safety.

## Q9: What are Local Workforce Development Boards required to do with their quality child care funds?
**A9:** Texas Government Code §2308.317 requires each Local Workforce Development Board to: (1) use at least 2 percent of the workforce area's annual allocation from TWC for quality child care initiatives, and (2) hire staff to provide mentoring assistance to providers that want to meet the quality requirements for Texas Rising Star certification or increase their level of certification. In FY'16, Boards used these funds to train thousands of providers on infant/toddler and prekindergarten guidelines and provide mentoring to over 11,000 caregivers and directors.

## Q10: What is the Texas School Ready! (TSR!) project and how is it funded?
**A10:** The Texas School Ready! (TSR!) project is a high-quality early childhood model administered by the Children's Learning Institute (CLI) based on proven school readiness components including: high-quality, developmentally appropriate curriculum; continuous student progress monitoring; professional development for teachers; and creation of a School Readiness Integration Partnership. The Texas legislature requires TWC to transfer $11.7 million of federal CCDF funds to TEA in each year of the biennium to assist providers participating in this integrated school readiness model.

## Q11: How does TWC measure whether parents return to TANF after leaving the child care program?
**A11:** A parent is considered to have returned to TANF or received TANF for the first time if the parent leaves subsidized child care and received TANF within a 12-month period. In 2014, 9.5% of parents who left the child care program received TANF within one year, showing a decrease from the 2012 peak of 12.00%. This metric helps TWC assess whether families maintain self-sufficiency after exiting child care services.

## Q12: What reporting requirements were added by Senate Bill 208 in 2015?
**A12:** Senate Bill 208 (84th Texas Legislature, Regular Session 2015) amended Texas Labor Code §302.0043 to require that TWC report findings regarding the effectiveness of the child care program to: (1) include information on employment results disaggregated by local workforce development area, and (2) identify multi-year trends in the information collected and analyzed by TWC, including trends for at least the five state fiscal years preceding the date of the report.

## Q13: How did TWC expand infant and toddler child care capacity in FY'15-'16?
**A13:** TWC distributed additional funds to Local Workforce Development Boards to increase capacity for infants and toddlers. Boards awarded funds to 295 licensed child care centers and 50 licensed or registered child care homes. These facilities expanded infant and toddler capacity by creating 1,619 slots for licensed child care centers and 69 slots for licensed or registered child care homes. Boards also promoted inclusive caregiving for infants and toddlers to 957 licensed child care centers and 73 licensed child care homes.

## Q14: What was the Military Communities Initiative and what were its results?
**A14:** In FY'16, TWC distributed funds to eight Boards with military installations in their workforce areas to strengthen the quality of child care services for military communities by increasing the number of nationally accredited facilities. Through this initiative: 88 child care facilities received grants and are working toward national accreditation, seven facilities achieved national accreditation, 142 facilities received mentoring services, and 820 caregivers received professional development activities.

## Q15: How do Boards leverage local funds to expand child care services?
**A15:** In FY'16, Boards entered into 62 local match agreements with colleges and universities, which certified approximately $14.5 million in child care expenses to draw down approximately $27.6 million in federal CCDF matching funds. Additionally, Boards entered into 74 local agreements with ISDs, where ISDs contributed approximately $12.9 million in local child care funds, drawing down approximately $24.5 million in federal CCDF funds. A large percentage of these federal funds is used to provide before- and after-school child care for children in local ISDs.

## Q16: What online training courses were made available to child care providers in FY'16?
**A16:** During FY'16, through a partnership between TWC, DFPS, and Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Services, Texas caregivers completed 84,521 AgriLife online courses, including 12,197 infant and toddler inclusion courses, 4,221 preschool and school-age inclusion courses, and 68,103 health and safety courses. These courses are aligned with the reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act to help child care providers comply with new requirements.

## Q17: What is the Improving Teacher Preparation project?
**A17:** The Improving Teacher Preparation project, administered by the Children's Learning Institute (CLI) at UT Health Science Center at Houston, was developed using $1 million in federal CCDF funds transferred to TEA. The project aims to facilitate participation in high-quality professional development opportunities for early childhood education professionals seeking a bachelor's degree, associate's degree, or CDA certificate. Its four key goals include: increasing knowledge of early childhood research among higher education faculty, providing high-quality training to aspiring teachers, supporting articulation agreements between institutions, and encouraging sustainability plans for teacher preparation programs.

## Q18: What strategies did TWC identify to encourage parents to choose Texas Rising Star providers?
**A18:** TWC identified several strategies to encourage parents to choose quality providers: (1) Reduce the parent share of cost for choosing a quality child care provider (which TWC implemented through rule amendments effective October 1, 2016, allowing Boards to reduce assessed parent fees for TRS providers), (2) Provide income tax credits (not feasible for Texas since there is no state income tax), and (3) Offer priority enrollment when parents choose quality providers (which TWC decided not to pursue to maintain existing priorities for very low-income families and special populations).

## Q19: What percentage of subsidized children were enrolled with Texas Rising Star providers between 2014 and 2016?
**A19:** The percentage of subsidized children enrolled with Texas Rising Star providers remained relatively constant at approximately 29% of the total number of children receiving subsidized care annually between 2014 and 2016. However, the average number of children per day enrolled in TRS-certified facilities increased from 30,715 in September 2015 to 35,558 in September 2016, showing growth in actual enrollment numbers.

## Q20: What significant payment policy change did TWC implement in October 2016?
**A20:** Effective October 1, 2016, TWC's three-member Commission amended Child Care Services rules to reimburse all child care providers based on the child's authorized enrollment rather than based on daily attendance (with allowed absences). This change was made to comply with the CCDBG Act of 2014, which requires states to establish payment policies that reflect generally accepted payment practices for child care providers who do not serve subsidized children, providing more stable and predictable revenue for providers.
