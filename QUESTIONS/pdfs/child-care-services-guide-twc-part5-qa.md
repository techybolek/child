# Questions and Answers: Child Care Services Guide TWC Part 5

## Question 1: How are child care providers paid for subsidized children?
**Answer:** Regulated child care providers are paid based on a child's enrollment authorization, excluding periods of suspension. The payment is prospective and based on the unit of service authorized:
- Full-day unit: 6 to 12 hours of care within a 24-hour period
- Part-day unit: fewer than 6 hours of care within a 24-hour period
- Blended-day unit: for children enrolled in school programs, pre-K, Head Start, or Early Head Start where care is provided part-day with occasional full-day care

Parent travel time to and from the child care facility and the parent's work, school, or job training site must be included when determining the payment unit.

## Question 2: What happens if a child care provider is placed on corrective action by Child Care Regulation (CCR)?
**Answer:** When a provider is placed on probation corrective action by CCR, Boards must:
- Notify parents with children in TWC-funded child care in writing of the provider's corrective action status within five business days
- Stop making new referrals to the provider while on corrective action probationary status
- The provider cannot be paid at the Board's enhanced payment rates while on probation corrective action status
- Children currently enrolled can remain at the facility

## Question 3: How is fraud defined in the child care program?
**Answer:** An individual commits fraud in relation to Child Care Services (CCS) if, to obtain or increase a benefit or payment for themselves or another individual, they:
- Make a false statement or representation, knowing it to be false, OR
- Knowingly fail to disclose a material fact

This can include parents not reporting household composition or income changes, providers submitting false attendance records, or anyone presenting fraudulent information to receive child care subsidies they're not entitled to receive.

## Question 4: What is the difference between relative providers and regulated providers for payment purposes?
**Answer:** Relative providers have different payment rules:
- They are paid based on actual attendance AFTER care is provided (not prospectively)
- They are NOT paid for days when a child is absent
- Absences for children in relative care don't count toward the maximum number of absences allowed
- There are no paid "holidays" for relative providers
- They cannot be paid for more children than permitted by CCR minimum standards for registered child care homes (though Boards may permit more on a case-by-case basis)

## Question 5: What happens when a provider is debarred from the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP)?
**Answer:** When a provider is placed on the USDA National Disqualification List (NDL) for CACFP violations, Boards must:
- Notify parents within two business days that the provider is no longer eligible for subsidized child care
- Give parents the option to keep children enrolled OR transfer to another provider
- If parents choose to keep children at the facility, it's considered a voluntary withdrawal from subsidized CCS
- Parents who transfer must choose an eligible provider within 10 business days
- All current referrals end within 10 business days after parent notification
- No new referrals can be made to the provider
- The transfer is NOT counted against the parent under the Board's transfer policy

## Question 6: What is a Notice of Freeze and how does it affect provider payments?
**Answer:** A Notice of Freeze is issued by TWC's Fraud and Detection Collections Management (FDCM) when a child care provider is delinquent in paying unemployment compensation contributions, wages, or related penalties. When a Board receives a Notice of Freeze:
- A 60-day freeze must be placed on any child care subsidies owed to the provider
- The Board must respond to FDCM within 20 days indicating the nature and value of subsidies owed
- Any subsequent payments during the 60-day period must be held
- TWC may issue a Notice of Levy requesting held funds be transferred to TWC
- The freeze doesn't make the provider ineligible to care for subsidized children, but the provider may choose to discontinue services
- Providers on a Notice of Freeze or Levy are NOT eligible for the Texas Rising Star program

## Question 7: What consumer education information must Boards provide to parents?
**Answer:** Boards must provide consumer education information including:
- Information about Texas Information and Referral Network/2-1-1 Texas
- The website and phone number for Child Care Regulation (CCR) for health and safety requirements
- Information on prevention and control of infectious diseases (including immunizations)
- Building and physical premises safety information
- Regulatory compliance history of child care providers
- Description of the full range of eligible child care providers
- Information on Texas Rising Star and quality rating systems

## Question 8: Under what circumstances can Boards recoup improper payments from parents?
**Answer:** Boards can only recoup improper payments from parents in these specific circumstances:
- Instances involving fraud as defined in the guide
- When the parent received CCS while awaiting an appeal and the determination was affirmed by the hearing officer
- When the parent fails to pay the Parent Share of Cost (PSoC) and the Board's policy is to pay the provider for the parent's failure to pay

Important: Parents cannot be held responsible for repayment when Board or Board contractor error resulted in the improper payment. Parents owing recoupments are prohibited from future child care eligibility until repayment is made (unless they're Choices or SNAP E&T participants).

## Question 9: What actions can be taken against providers who fail to comply with TWC rules?
**Answer:** When providers fail to comply with TWC rules, corrective actions may include:
- Closing intake (stopping new referrals)
- Moving children to another provider selected by parents
- Withholding provider payments or reimbursement of costs
- Recouping funds
- Ending the provider agreement
- Creating a Service Improvement Agreement (SIA) that outlines steps to reach compliance, time limits, and consequences of noncompliance

When determining corrective actions, Boards must consider the scope of the violation, severity of the violation, and the compliance history of the provider.

## Question 10: What are the required actions when CCR takes adverse action against a provider?
**Answer:** When Child Care Regulation (CCR) is taking adverse action against a provider, Boards must:
- Notify parents within TWO business days (in writing or by telephone) that CCR intends to take adverse action
- Transfer children to another eligible provider within FIVE business days of receiving TWC notification
- Stop all new referrals to the provider while CCR is taking adverse action
- Ensure the provider is not paid at enhanced rates
- Parents must be given the option to select the new provider

Adverse actions are taken when a provider has deficiencies that pose a risk to health and safety of children, or when there's continued failure to comply with standards, rules, or child care law. Adverse actions can include denial of application, revocation or suspension of permit, or adverse amendment with conditions.
