# Q&A: Fifth Tranche CRRSA ARPA Projects - February 1, 2022 Commission Meeting

## Overview and Funding Sources

Q1: What are the three main sources of COVID-19 federal child care funding that TWC received?
A1: TWC received child care funding from three COVID-19 federal legislative acts: (1) CARES Act totaling $371,663,374, which primarily funded enhanced reimbursement rates for subsidy providers and a temporary essential worker child care program; (2) CRRSA (Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021) totaling $1,135,748,591; and (3) ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) totaling $4,424,303,632, which includes $1,703,369,713 in CCDF Discretionary Funds and $2,724,368,837 in CCDF Stabilization Grant Funds.

Q2: What is the total amount of COVID-19 child care stimulus funding TWC received across all three federal acts?
A2: TWC received a total of $5,935,150,515 in COVID-19 child care stimulus funding across the CARES Act, CRRSA, and ARPA. Each funding source has different obligation and expenditure deadlines, with CARES and CRRSA funds needing to be obligated by September 30, 2022 and expended by September 30, 2023, while ARPA Discretionary funds must be obligated by September 30, 2023 and expended by September 30, 2024.

Q3: How much funding did the Commission recommend allocating in the Fifth Tranche, and what was the remaining balance after these recommendations?
A3: The Fifth Tranche recommended allocating $1,098,545,000 across six major initiative areas. This brought the total approved funding across all tranches to $5,723,507,696, leaving a remaining balance of $211,642,819 from the total $5.9 billion appropriated.

## Issue 1: Outreach and Education Campaigns

Q4: What was the recommended funding amount for outreach and education campaigns, and what specific campaigns were these funds intended to support?
A4: Staff recommended dedicating $10 million in federal child care stimulus funds to support child care education and outreach campaigns. These campaigns include a parent outreach and education campaign on the importance of quality child care and information about Texas Rising Star to help parents identify TWC's quality-rated providers, as well as a recruitment campaign to address staffing shortages that child care providers are experiencing.

Q5: What prompted the Commission to consider funding a recruitment campaign for child care workers?
A5: At the November 2, 2021 Commission Meeting, two public commentators spoke about staffing shortages that child care providers are experiencing, which results in providers closing classrooms and being unable to serve as many children as there is capacity. In response to these concerns, the Commission directed TWC staff to examine opportunities to support a recruitment campaign.

## Issue 2: Training Support Strategies

Q6: How much total funding was recommended for training support strategies, and what are the main components?
A6: A total of $13,545,000 was recommended for training support strategies, divided into three main components: $8,000,000 for Texas A&M AgriLife online trainings, $4,545,000 for Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) practitioner training, and $1,000,000 for Skills for Small Business training specific to the child care industry.

Q7: What enhancements to Texas A&M AgriLife training offerings would the $8 million support?
A7: The funding would support several enhancements including: integrating the AgriLife learning management system with TECPDS so training courses automatically transfer to educators' workforce registry accounts; migrating business courses previously contracted through Collaborative for Children into the AgriLife database; expanding course offerings to include topics like Starting a Home-Based Child Care Business, Non-Traditional Hours programs, Teaching in Natural Learning Environments, Child Care Director Credential Series, and CDA Alignment; and providing early childhood professionals free access to courses meeting Child Care Regulation training requirements through Fiscal Year 2024.

Q8: What is the purpose of the Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) practitioner training, and who would it serve?
A8: The ECI practitioner training would train and support child care providers, Texas Rising Star mentors, and Infant-Toddler Specialists on conducting developmental screenings, Child Find (a federal IDEA mandate to locate children who may qualify for ECI services), and working with local ECI providers to jointly serve eligible children. The training addresses the need for increased outreach to directors, teachers, and child care staff who can help identify and direct families to available ECI resources for children birth to 36 months with developmental delays or disabilities.

Q9: What are the eligibility parameters for the Skills for Small Business (SSB) program supplemented with child care stimulus funding?
A9: The SSB program parameters for child care providers include: child care employers with under 100 employees; training for full-time employees only; within a 12-month period, funding for tuition and fees up to $1,800 per newly hired employee (hired within 12 months of the SSB application date) or $900 per incumbent worker; training provided by a public community or technical college or Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service (TEEX); and training selected from active course catalogs/schedules including credit, continuing education, online, or other available unpublished courses.

## Issue 3: Child Care Relief Funds Expansion

Q10: How much additional funding was recommended for the 2022 Child Care Relief Funds (CCRF), and what was the rationale for this expansion?
A10: Staff recommended dedicating an additional $1 billion in COVID stimulus funding to 2022 CCRF, bringing the total CCRF to $3.45 billion. The rationale was to provide additional assistance allowing providers flexibility to determine how best to invest funds to support their child care businesses, particularly noting concerns about child care employment levels and staff compensation. The expansion addresses industry challenges including slow employment recovery from pandemic levels and workers leaving the industry for better pay elsewhere.

Q11: What types of compensation and benefits could child care providers consider offering using the expanded 2022 CCRF funds?
A11: Providers were encouraged to consider using CCRF funds for one-time or time-limited benefits including: hiring bonuses, retention bonuses, wage supplements, free or reduced-cost child care for their staff, paid time off, teacher classroom supply stipends/reimbursements, professional development assistance/tuition reimbursement, health insurance/assistance with premiums, and retirement contributions. These enhanced compensation and benefits packages would help recruit and retain child care staff.

Q12: What are the allowable uses of Child Care Relief Funds under the ARPA Stabilization Grant provisions?
A12: The Commission approved broad and flexible use of CCRF to assist providers with recovering from the economic effects of the pandemic. Allowable uses include staff compensation as well as other operating costs such as rent, utilities, maintenance/repair expenses, sanitation supplies/services, and personal protective equipment (PPE). This flexibility allows providers to determine how to best invest the funds to support their child care businesses.

## Issue 4: Capacity-Building Grants

Q13: What is a "child care desert" as defined in the Texas Labor Code, and how much funding was recommended for capacity-building in these areas?
A13: According to Texas Labor Code §302.0461, a child care desert is defined as an area of the state where the number of children with working parents younger than six is three times greater than the licensed child care capacity. The Fifth Tranche recommended $75 million total for capacity-building grants, which includes funding for child care desert capacity expansion, infant capacity expansion, and employer site-based child care.

Q14: What are the different Start-Up Award amounts available for child care desert capacity expansion based on licensed capacity?
A14: The Start-Up Award amounts for general capacity expansion vary by licensed capacity: Licensed Centers with 101 or more children receive $75,000; 75-100 children receive $60,000; 50-74 children receive $45,000; 25-49 children receive $30,000; 0-24 children receive $15,000. Licensed Homes serving up to 12 children receive $8,000, and Registered Homes serving up to 6 children receive $4,000.

Q15: How does the infant capacity expansion funding work, and can providers receive both infant expansion and desert expansion awards?
A15: For infant capacity expansion (ages 0-17 months), providers receive $2,000 per new infant slot in all areas of the state, whether in child care deserts or non-deserts. If a provider is opening in a child care desert and expanding infant capacity, this amount is in addition to the Child Care Desert Expansion Start-Up Awards that a provider may also receive, meaning they can stack both types of awards.

Q16: What business plan requirements must applicants meet to receive capacity-building grants?
A16: All applicants must submit a business plan, meet virtually with TWC's contracted entity/entities to review their business plan, and participate in technical assistance as determined necessary to improve their business plan and position the applicant to operate a successful business. Child Care Desert and Employer Site-Based Capacity Expansion applicants must use the SBA's "How to Start a Quality Child Care Business, Appendix A: Business Plan Outline for Child Care Centers," while Child Care Infant Capacity Expansion applicants submit a modified/targeted business plan addressing the infant expansion provisions.

Q17: What are Initial Operating Awards, and how are they calculated for different types of capacity expansion?
A17: Initial Operating Awards are issued prior to the child care program opening to assist providers in their first few months of operation. For Child Care Desert and Employer Site-Based awards, the amount is calculated as: Provider capacity × MRS 75th Percentile Average Cost × 3 months (63 days). For Child Care Infant Initial Operating Awards, the calculation is: New Infant Capacity × MRS 75th Percentile Cost for Infants × 3 months (63 days). These awards are issued when providers receive their Initial Operating Permit or modified Operating Permit from Child Care Regulation.

Q18: What restrictions exist on the use of CCDF funds for capacity-building projects?
A18: CCDF funds cannot be used for construction, major renovations, or the purchase or improvement of land. Major renovation is specifically defined as: (1) structural changes to the foundation, roof, floor, exterior or load-bearing walls of a facility, or the extension of a facility to increase its floor area; or (2) extensive alteration of a facility such as to significantly change its function and purpose, even if such renovation does not include any structural change.

Q19: What allowable uses of Start-Up Award funding were identified in the capacity-building grants?
A19: Allowable uses include indoor equipment and furnishings (cribs, changing tables, bookshelves, chairs, tables, rugs); office furnishings and equipment (desks, chairs, filing cabinets, computers, software, printers); outdoor equipment (playgrounds, shade structures, toys, balls, fencing, infant strollers); kitchen supplies excluding food (appliances, cookware, serving items); safety supplies (fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, baby gates, outlet covers); education supplies/classroom materials (curriculum, books, toys); and permitting fees (CCR, inspections).

Q20: How would Local Workforce Development Boards support the child care industry under the capacity-building initiative?
A20: Boards could identify or hire new staff dedicated to child care business outreach and support, with funding available through April 2024. These staff would help the child care industry by: making connections with TWC's Child Care Provider Expansion entities; connecting with TWC-funded business coaching and training; educating businesses on how Workforce Solutions can assist with hiring support and other workforce services; informing about the Child Care Services program and Texas Rising Star quality rating system; connecting with Child Care Regulation to learn about regulatory requirements; connecting with Texas Department of Agriculture regarding the Child and Adult Care Food Program; and raising awareness of the Child Care Availability Portal and TECPDS.

Q21: What support would Child Care Regulation (CCR) receive to assist with child care industry expansion?
A21: The Commission recommended providing $1 million to Child Care Regulation to hire five temporary positions funded through April 2024. These positions would assist prospective new child care providers in understanding CCR's regulatory requirements, understanding how local ordinances may also need to be considered, and accessing other resources available to assist new child care operations.

## Timeline and Historical Context

Q22: What were the previously approved tranches of funding, and what major initiatives did they support?
A22: Previous tranches included the First Tranche (May 2021) with $580 million for 2021 CCRF and $15 million for TA/Business Coaches; Second Tranche (June 2021) with $500 million for SIR Child Care, $30 million for TRS Supports, $1.2 million for TRS Contracted Slots Pilot, and $3.45 million for Early Childhood Apprenticeship Pilot; Third Tranche (October 2021) with $2.45 billion for 2022 CCRF and $42.5 million for TWC Program/Admin Costs; and Fourth Tranche (November 2021) with $293.2 million for Low Income Child Care, $287 million for Provider Enrollment/Growth, $26 million for Pre-K Partnership Expansion, $25 million each for Matching Grant to Improve Quality and Shared Services Alliances, and other initiatives.

Q23: What is the significance of the different obligation and expenditure deadlines for the various funding sources?
A23: The deadlines are critical for ensuring proper use of federal funds. CARES and CRRSA funds must be obligated by September 30, 2022 and expended by September 30, 2023. ARPA Stabilization funds (including the 10% admin/TA/capacity-building portion and provider funds) also must be obligated by September 30, 2022 and expended by September 30, 2023. However, ARPA Discretionary funds have more time, requiring obligation by September 30, 2023 and expenditure by September 30, 2024. These deadlines drive the urgency of the Commission's decision-making on fund allocation.

Q24: What prompted the development of the parent outreach campaign on Texas Rising Star that was included in the CRRSA Planned Use of Funds Report?
A24: The parent outreach and education campaign on the importance of quality child care, including information about Texas Rising Star, reflected input the Commission received from the Texas Rising Star Workgroup. The Workgroup's recommendations to the Commission included developing an outreach plan to emphasize family and consumer education around selecting high-quality programs, and encouraging and informing programs to remain or become high-quality programs.

Q25: According to the document, what employment challenges is the child care industry facing post-pandemic?
A25: The child care industry is experiencing significant employment challenges including extensive job losses due to COVID-19, slow employment recovery that has not reached pre-pandemic levels, and workers leaving the industry for better pay elsewhere. These staffing shortages result in providers closing classrooms and being unable to serve as many children as there is capacity. Reports from the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment and Business Insider document these struggles, highlighting the need for enhanced compensation and benefits packages to recruit and retain staff.
