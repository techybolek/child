# BCY 2026 Parent Share of Cost (PSoC) Chart - Q&A

## Question-Answer Pairs

### Q1: What is the Parent Share of Cost (PSoC) and how does it work?
**A1:** The Parent Share of Cost (PSoC) is a sliding fee scale that determines how much families pay toward their child care costs based on their income level. The PSoC is calculated as a percentage of family income and varies based on the family's State Median Income (SMI) percentage, ranging from 1% to 85% SMI. The percentage families pay increases as their income increases, ranging from 2.00% of income at the lowest level (1% SMI) to 7.00% at the highest level (85% SMI) for one child.

### Q3: What is the monthly PSoC for a family of 4 with one child in care earning $3,159 per month?
**A3:** A family of 4 earning $3,159 per month falls into the 35% State Median Income bracket. For one child in care, their monthly PSoC would be $135, which equals approximately $31 per week. This represents 4.26% of their monthly income.

### Q4: How much does a family of 3 with two children in care pay at 45% SMI?
**A4:** A family of 3 at 45% SMI has a monthly income of $3,411. Their monthly PSoC for two children would be $191, which breaks down to approximately $43 per week. This represents the base 4.93% for the first child plus an additional 0.675% for the second child.

### Q5: What income levels correspond to each State Median Income (SMI) percentage for a family of 5?
**A5:** For a family of 5, the monthly income thresholds are: $105 (1% SMI), $1,571 (15% SMI), $2,617 (25% SMI), $3,664 (35% SMI), $4,711 (45% SMI), $5,757 (55% SMI), $6,804 (65% SMI), $7,851 (75% SMI), and $8,897 (85% SMI). These thresholds determine which sliding fee scale bracket the family falls into.

### Q6: What is the maximum weekly PSoC a family of 5 with four children would pay?
**A6:** The maximum weekly PSoC for a family of 5 with four children is $142, which occurs at the 85% SMI income level ($8,897 monthly income). The corresponding monthly PSoC is $623. Interestingly, this amount is the same whether they have 2, 3, or 4 children in care at this income level.

### Q7: How does the PSoC percentage for one child change across different income brackets?
**A7:** The PSoC percentage for one child increases progressively across income brackets: 2.00% at 1% SMI, 2.93% at 15% SMI, 3.60% at 25% SMI, 4.26% at 35% SMI, 4.93% at 45% SMI, 5.60% at 55% SMI, 6.26% at 65% SMI, 6.93% at 75% SMI, and 7.00% at 85% SMI. The rate increases more gradually at higher income levels.

### Q8: What tool is recommended for calculating the exact PSoC amount for a family?
**A8:** The document recommends using the PSoC Calculator to determine the exact PSoC amount based on your family's specific situation. The calculator takes into account three key factors: family size, monthly income, and the number of children in care, providing precise monthly and weekly PSoC amounts.

### Q9: What is the difference in monthly PSoC between a family of 2 and a family of 4, both with one child at 55% SMI?
**A9:** At 55% SMI with one child, a family of 2 (income $3,375) pays $189 monthly, while a family of 4 (income $4,964) pays $278 monthly. The difference is $89 per month, reflecting the higher income threshold for larger families. Both families pay 5.60% of their respective incomes as PSoC.

### Q10: At what income level does the add-on for additional children become most significant, and when does it disappear?
**A10:** The add-on for additional children is most significant at the 55% SMI level at 0.825%, which is the highest add-on percentage across all income brackets. The add-on then decreases substantially to 0.738% at 65% SMI, drops dramatically to just 0.072% at 75% SMI, and completely disappears (0.000%) at 85% SMI. This means families at the highest income bracket pay the same PSoC regardless of how many children they have in care.
