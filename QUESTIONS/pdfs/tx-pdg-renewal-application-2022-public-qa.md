# Texas PDG B-5 Renewal Application 2022 - Q&A

## Q1: What is the Texas PDG B-5 Renewal Grant and what are its primary goals?
**A1:** The Texas PDG B-5 Renewal Grant is a comprehensive early childhood initiative that builds upon the accomplishments of the initial PDG B-5 grant. Its primary goals are to maximize parental choice, increase access to high-quality early childhood programs, improve coordination and transitions between programs, and support the early childhood workforce. The grant focuses on enhancing Texas's mixed-delivery system through strategic investments in needs assessment, strategic planning, maximizing parental choice and knowledge, sharing best practices, and improving the overall quality of early childhood care and education.

## Q2: Which state agencies are involved in the PDG B-5 governance structure and what are their roles?
**A2:** The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) serves as the lead agency administering the grant, working collaboratively with the Texas Education Agency (TEA) and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). TWC manages child care services and workforce development, TEA oversees prekindergarten programs and educational standards, and HHSC handles Early Childhood Intervention services. This interagency collaboration is governed by the Early Learning Council, which provides strategic direction and ensures coordination across the state's early childhood system.

## Q3: How does the PDG B-5 grant plan to engage families and support parental choice?
**A3:** The grant implements multiple family engagement strategies including expanding the Help Me Grow (HMG) System Model to additional regions, providing training and technical assistance to Family Engagement Specialists, creating resource hubs in underserved communities, and developing culturally responsive materials in multiple languages. The initiative emphasizes building parent leadership capacity through training programs and establishing family advisory councils that give parents a meaningful voice in program design and implementation decisions affecting their children's early learning experiences.

## Q4: What is the Early Educator Pathways workforce development model?
**A4:** The Early Educator Pathways model is a competency-based career lattice system designed to create clear advancement opportunities for early childhood professionals. It includes Registered Apprenticeship Programs (RAPs) that allow educators to earn credentials like the Child Development Associate (CDA) while working, establishing stackable credentials that lead to higher education degrees, and providing financial supports such as scholarships and wage supplements. The model aims to professionalize the early childhood workforce, reduce turnover, and improve program quality by creating sustainable career pathways.

## Q5: What plans does Texas have for updating its needs assessment during the renewal period?
**A5:** Texas plans to conduct a comprehensive mixed-methods needs assessment that includes quantitative data analysis, qualitative stakeholder engagement through surveys and focus groups, and geographic mapping to identify gaps in service delivery. The assessment will examine access to high-quality programs across populations and regions, workforce capacity and professional development needs, family engagement and awareness levels, and coordination between early childhood programs. Special attention will be given to underserved populations including children with disabilities, dual language learners, children experiencing homelessness, and those in rural communities.

## Q6: How will the PDG B-5 grant utilize subgranting strategies?
**A6:** The grant will issue competitive subgrants to local communities, workforce boards, and early childhood organizations to support targeted initiatives aligned with state priorities. Subgrant activities include expanding access in child care deserts and underserved areas, implementing quality improvement initiatives for programs seeking Texas Rising Star certification, developing innovative family engagement programs, creating community-based professional development opportunities for early educators, and piloting coordination models between early childhood programs and elementary schools to improve transition outcomes for children entering kindergarten.

## Q7: What is the Early Childhood Integrated Data System (ECIDS) and how will it be developed?
**A7:** The ECIDS is a comprehensive data infrastructure designed to link information across multiple early childhood programs and agencies to provide a holistic view of children's experiences and outcomes. Development efforts include establishing data governance agreements between TWC, TEA, and HHSC; creating unique child identifiers that protect privacy while enabling data linkage; developing dashboards and reporting tools for program administrators and policymakers; and building capacity for data-informed decision making at state and local levels. The system will support program evaluation, resource allocation, and continuous quality improvement efforts.

## Q8: How does the PDG B-5 grant plan to support children with disabilities and special needs?
**A8:** The grant prioritizes inclusion by expanding training for early childhood educators on inclusive practices and evidence-based interventions, strengthening referral pathways between child care programs and Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) services, providing technical assistance to programs serving children with disabilities, and developing resources for families navigating early childhood services. The initiative emphasizes collaboration with HHSC's ECI program to ensure seamless transitions and coordinated supports, while also investing in specialized equipment and environmental modifications that enable full participation of children with diverse abilities in early learning settings.

## Q9: What professional development opportunities are available through this grant?
**A9:** The grant offers a comprehensive professional development system including online learning platforms with stackable credentials and micro-credentials, in-person training through regional Education Service Centers and workforce development boards, coaching and mentoring programs that provide on-site support to educators, specialized training on topics such as trauma-informed care, social-emotional development, and culturally responsive practices, and leadership development programs for program directors and administrators. All professional development is aligned with the Texas Early Learning Guidelines and Texas Rising Star quality standards to ensure consistency and relevance.

## Q10: What sustainability plans are in place to continue PDG B-5 initiatives after federal funding ends?
**A10:** Texas has developed a multi-faceted sustainability strategy that includes integrating successful PDG initiatives into existing state-funded programs and services, leveraging braided funding from CCDF, state general revenue, and private partnerships, building local capacity through train-the-trainer models and community-based infrastructure, advocating for continued legislative support and appropriations for early childhood priorities, and documenting outcomes and return on investment to demonstrate the value of continued investment. The state is also exploring public-private partnerships and employer engagement strategies to diversify funding sources and create long-term support for the early childhood system.
