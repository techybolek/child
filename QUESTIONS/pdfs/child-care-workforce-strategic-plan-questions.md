# Questions and Answers: Child Care Workforce Strategic Plan 2023-2025

## Q1: What is House Bill 619 and what does it require?
**A:** House Bill 619, passed during the 87th Texas Legislature (2022), requires the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) to prepare a Child Care Workforce Strategic Plan to improve the quality of infant, toddler, preschool, and school-age child care workforce in Texas. The plan must be updated every three years and includes requirements for collecting demographic and workforce data from child care facilities, and must include recommendations for improving compensation, reducing turnover, eliminating pay disparities, and increasing professional development opportunities.

## Q2: What is the median wage for child care workers in Texas?
**A:** According to the Director Survey, the median wage of an early childhood educator in Texas is $12.00 per hour or $24,000 per year. This is equivalent to 52% of the State Median Income (SMI) for a single individual and 40% of SMI for a family of two. The average wage for Texas child care workers is $11.43 per hour according to the 2021 TWC Texas Wages Report for Child Care.

## Q3: How many children does Texas's child care subsidy program serve?
**A:** In Fiscal Year 2023, TWC's annual allocation of $1.1 billion provides child care financial assistance for approximately 140,000 children per day. This represents only about 12% of the entire licensed capacity of privately-operated child care programs in the state. The program has a waiting list of approximately 60,000 children.

## Q4: What are the three main goals of the Child Care Workforce Strategic Plan?
**A:** The three main goals are:
1. **Support the Current Child Care Workforce** - through TECPDS support and identifying opportunities to stabilize the workforce and promote hiring/retention of high-quality early educators
2. **Support a Pipeline of Qualified Child Care Workers** - by increasing high school graduates working as early childhood educators and supporting educational advancement through stackable credentials
3. **Examine Opportunities to Improve Administration and Oversight of the CCS Program** - by improving data access and aligning Workforce Boards on best practices

## Q5: What are the demographics of the Texas child care workforce?
**A:** Women comprise 96% of early childhood educators in Texas. The racial/ethnic breakdown for center-based educators is: Hispanic (43%), White (30%), Black (19%), with smaller percentages of Asian, Middle Eastern, Pacific Islander, Native American, and multiracial educators. Home-based educators have a similar distribution with slightly more Black educators (28%) and fewer Hispanic educators (35%).

## Q6: What is the educational attainment of the child care workforce?
**A:** Most commonly, early childhood educators have no degree or certification beyond high school (58%). Only 17% of the collective ECE workforce holds a bachelor's degree or higher. About 15% have completed a Child Development Associate (CDA) or similar credential, and 17% attended some college but have not completed a degree. Educational levels are slightly higher among home-based owners, with 39% having a CDA or associate's degree.

## Q7: How does child care impact the Texas economy?
**A:** Child care has a significant economic impact on Texas. According to a 2021 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation survey, almost 74% of Texas parents reported missing work due to child care issues in the past 3 months, and approximately 32% experienced employment changes due to child care issues. The economic impact includes an estimated $7.59 billion annual cost to Texas employers due to employee absences and turnover, and $1.8 billion annual loss in tax revenue.

## Q8: What professional development system supports Texas child care workers?
**A:** The Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS) is the main professional development system. It provides the Texas early childhood educator Workforce Registry and Trainer Registry, collects and centralizes workforce information, and supports educators to advance their careers. However, the Director Survey found that less than half of directors report having a TECPDS account, and 21% have never heard of it.

## Q9: What are the main challenges in hiring child care workers?
**A:** According to the survey, major challenges include: people not wanting to work in child care, wages being too low to attract quality staff, other job opportunities paying more than child care programs can offer, and inability to find qualified candidates. The industry struggles with high turnover rates and difficulty maintaining adequate staffing levels.

## Q10: How much federal stimulus funding did Texas receive for child care, and how was it used?
**A:** Texas received approximately $5.9 billion in one-time federal CCDF funds related to the COVID-19 pandemic. TWC used about half of these funds ($3 billion) to provide one-time support to the entire child care industry through the Child Care Relief Fund, which awarded funding to about 10,800 regulated child care providers. These funds could be used for wage supplements, one-time bonuses, and maintaining or resuming program operations, and were available through November 2023.
