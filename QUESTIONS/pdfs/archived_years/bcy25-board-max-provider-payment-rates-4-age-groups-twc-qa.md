## Q1: When do the Board Contract Year 2025 child care provider payment rates become effective?
**A1:** The Board Contract Year 2025 child care provider payment rates become effective on October 1, 2024. These rates are detailed in WD Letter 19-24, Attachment 1, and apply to all workforce development boards across Texas.

## Q2: What are the different provider types that have payment rates listed in this document?
**A2:** The document lists payment rates for four main provider types: LCCC (Licensed Child Care Center), LCCH (Licensed Child Care Home), RCCH (Registered Child Care Home), and Relative providers. Each provider type has different rate structures based on their rating level and the age group of children served.

## Q3: What do the rating levels TRS, TSR, and "Reg" mean for child care providers?
**A3:** "Reg" refers to regular or non-rated providers without special certifications. TRS stands for Texas Rising Star, which has levels TRS2, TRS3, and TRS4 (with TRS4 being the highest quality rating). TSR stands for Texas School Ready, which is another quality rating designation. Providers with higher ratings receive increased payment rates to reflect their quality standards.

## Q4: What are the four age groups used to categorize payment rates in this document?
**A4:** The four age groups are: Infant (youngest children), Toddler, Preschool, and School-age. Each age group has different payment rates, with infant care typically commanding the highest rates due to the lower child-to-staff ratios required. Payment rates decrease progressively from infant care to school-age care.

---

## Q5: How do full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) rates differ across the workforce boards?
**A5:** Full-time (FT) rates are consistently higher than part-time (PT) rates across all workforce boards and provider types. For example, in the Alamo-20 board, a Licensed Child Care Center (LCCC) regular rating charges $44.40 for infant FT care compared to $40.66 for infant PT care. The rate difference reflects the commitment and scheduling differences between full-time and part-time enrollment.

---

## Q6: What is the "Blended" (BT) rate category for school-age children?
**A6:** The Blended (BT) rate is a special rate category that applies only to school-age children. It represents a payment rate that falls between the full-time and part-time rates, designed to accommodate children who may need care before and after school but not for full days. For instance, in the Capital Area-14 board, school-age BT rates are $43.72 for LCCC regular rating, positioned between the FT rate of $52.60 and PT rate of $42.20.

## Q7: Which Texas workforce board area has the highest infant full-time rates for Licensed Child Care Centers?
**A7:** The Capital Area-14 workforce board has among the highest infant full-time rates, with regular LCCC providers receiving $61.80 for infant FT care. This reflects the higher cost of living and operating child care facilities in the Austin metropolitan area. The TRS4 rated centers in this board can receive up to $67.55 for infant full-time care.

---

## Q8: How much more do Texas Rising Star (TRS) rated providers receive compared to regular providers?
**A8:** Texas Rising Star providers receive incrementally higher rates based on their rating level. For example, in the Gulf Coast-28 board, a regular LCCC receives $46.60 for infant FT, while TRS2 receives $48.94 (approximately 5% more), TRS3 receives $49.93 (approximately 7% more), and TRS4 receives $51.40 (approximately 10% more). This progressive increase incentivizes providers to achieve and maintain higher quality standards.

---

## Q9: What are the payment rates for relative providers, and how do they compare to licensed facilities?
**A9:** Relative providers receive significantly lower payment rates compared to licensed facilities. For example, in the Alamo-20 board, relatives receive $18.61 for infant FT care, while a regular LCCC receives $44.40 for the same service—less than half the rate. Relative rates vary by board but generally range from $8 to $24 per day depending on the age group and workforce board area. These lower rates reflect the informal nature of relative care and different regulatory requirements.

---

## Q10: How do payment rates vary across different Texas workforce board regions?
**A10:** Payment rates vary significantly across Texas workforce boards to reflect regional differences in cost of living and market rates. Urban areas like Capital Area-14 (Austin), Gulf Coast-28 (Houston), and Tarrant County-5 (Fort Worth) have substantially higher rates than rural areas. For example, infant FT care at a regular LCCC ranges from $31.80 in Northeast Texas-7 to $61.80 in Capital Area-14. This geographic variation ensures rates are appropriate for local economic conditions while maintaining access to quality child care across the state.
