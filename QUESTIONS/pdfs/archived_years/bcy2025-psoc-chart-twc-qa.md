# BCY2025 Parent Share of Cost (PSOC) Sliding Fee Scale - Q&A

## Q1: What is the Parent Share of Cost (PSOC) and how is it calculated for families with one child?
**A1:** The Parent Share of Cost (PSOC) is a sliding fee scale based on a family's income as a percentage of State Median Income (SMI). For families with one child, the PSOC ranges from 2.27% of income at 5% SMI to 7% of income at 80-85% SMI. The percentage increases progressively: 3.27% at 20% SMI, 3.93% at 30% SMI, 4.60% at 40% SMI, 5.26% at 50% SMI, 5.93% at 60% SMI, 6.60% at 70% SMI, and 6.93% at 75% SMI, capping at 7% for higher income levels.

## Q2: How does the PSOC change when families have multiple children in care?
**A2:** For each additional child beyond the first, families add 0.15% to their PSOC percentage, up to a maximum of 7% of their monthly income. For example, if a family pays 5% for one child, they would pay 5.15% for two children and 5.30% for three children, but the total would never exceed 7% of their income regardless of how many children are in care.

## Q3: What is the weekly PSOC for a family of 3 with a monthly income of $2,890 (40% SMI)?
**A3:** For a family of 3 with a monthly income of $2,890, the weekly PSOC for the first child is $30, and the weekly PSOC for the second child is $4, totaling $34 per week. The monthly total PSOC for this family is $150.

## Q4: At what income percentage does the PSOC cap at 7% for families with one child?
**A4:** The PSOC caps at 7% of income for families with one child when they reach 80% of State Median Income (SMI) and remains at 7% for 85% SMI as well. This means that families earning 80% or more of the state median income will not pay more than 7% of their income toward child care costs.

## Q5: How much would a family of 4 with a monthly income of $5,161 (60% SMI) pay monthly for child care?
**A5:** A family of 4 with a monthly income of $5,161 (60% SMI) would pay a monthly total PSOC of $352. This breaks down to $70 per week for the first child and $10 per week for the second child.

## Q6: What is the lowest monthly PSOC amount for a family of 2, and at what income level does this occur?
**A6:** The lowest monthly PSOC for a family of 2 is $7, which occurs at 5% of State Median Income (SMI), equivalent to a monthly income of $293. The weekly PSOC at this income level is just $2.

## Q7: How can families calculate their exact PSOC if their situation doesn't match the chart examples?
**A7:** Families should use the PSOC Calculator tool to calculate the exact PSOC amount for their specific family size, monthly income, and number of children in care. The chart provides general guidelines, but the calculator will provide precise amounts tailored to individual circumstances.

## Q8: What pattern do you see in the weekly PSOC for second children at higher income levels (75-85% SMI)?
**A8:** At higher income levels (75-85% SMI), the weekly PSOC for second children decreases significantly or drops to $0. This occurs because the 7% income cap is reached with just the first child's PSOC, so families at these income levels pay very little or nothing additional for the second child despite their higher earnings.

## Q9: What is the monthly income range covered by this BCY2025 PSOC chart for a family of 5?
**A9:** For a family of 5, the BCY2025 PSOC chart covers monthly incomes ranging from $499 (5% SMI) to $8,481 (85% SMI). The monthly total PSOC ranges from $12 at the lowest income level to $594 at the highest income level.

## Q10: If a family of 4 earning $6,021 per month (70% SMI) has three children in care, approximately how much would they pay weekly for the third child?
**A10:** Based on the chart's note, the weekly PSOC for the third child would be approximately $6 (the amount for the 2nd child) plus $1, totaling around $7 per week. This follows the pattern that each additional child costs approximately the 2nd child's amount plus $1, up to the 7% monthly income maximum.
