Its goal is to raise the standard of care for families that rely on subsidized child\u2011care services and to give providers a financial incentive to improve quality.\n\n| Feature | Detail | Source |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Purpose** | Quality\u2011improvement certification for providers that receive TWC\u2011funded Child Care Services (CCS). | [Doc 1] |\n| **Certification Levels** | Two\u2011Star (meets some standards), Three\u2011Star (meets most standards), Four\u2011Star (meets nearly all standards). | [Doc 2] |\n| **Reimbursement Incentives** | Enhanced reimbursement rates are set at least 5\u202f% higher than base rates for Two\u2011Star, 7\u202f% higher for Three\u2011Star, and 9\u202f% higher for Four\u2011Star certified providers. | [Doc 1] |\n| **Entry\u2011Level Designation** | Non\u2011certified providers were given 24\u202fmonths to reach at least a Two\u2011Star certification.

These hours count toward the 25\u202fhrs/week needed for single\u2011parent families. | [Doc\u202f3] |\n| 3 | Confirm the parent\u2019s **income** is \u2264\u202f85\u202f% of the State Median Income (SMI). | The 85\u202f% SMI cap is the income threshold for all low\u2011income child\u2011care programs. | [Doc\u202f4] |\n| 4 | Ensure the parent meets the **activity requirement**: at least 25\u202fhrs/week of total activity (education\u202f+\u202femployment\u202f+\u202fother). | The Child Care Services Guide requires a single\u2011parent family to have a combined 25\u202fhrs/week of activity; for *education* this is satisfied by the calculated hours. | [Doc\u202f4] |\n| 5 | If the parent also has **part\u2011time employment**, add those hours to the total activity. | Even part\u2011time work contributes to the 25\u2011hr minimum, but the *employment* requirement for initial job\u2011search child care (12\u202fhrs/week) applies only to the *initial job\u2011search* program, not to the education\u2011based program. | [Doc\u202f5] |\n| 6 | Apply the **60\u2011month cumulative limit** for full\u2011time undergraduate education. | Boards must enforce a cumulative limit of 60\u202fmonths (5\u202fyears) of education\u2011based assistance. Once the limit is reached, the parent reverts to standard eligibility (based on employment/education hours). | [Doc\u202f1] |\n| 7 | Treat any **temporary interruption** (e.g., family leave, sick leave, or a three\u2011month break) as an *eligible* period so long as income remains \u2264\u202f85\u202f% SMI. | The Board is instructed to consider children eligible during such interruptions, preventing a loss of benefits. | [Doc\u202f2] |\n\n### What happens if the mom\u2019s part\u2011time work hours fall short of the required 12\u202fhrs/week?\n\n- **Education\u2011based program**: The parent can still qualify as long as the *combined* education and work hours reach 25\u202fhrs/week and income \u2264\u202f85\u202f% SMI. The education hours are counted even if the parent is not meeting the 12\u202fhrs employment requirement for the *initial job\u2011search* program.  \n- **Initial Job\u2011Search program**: If the parent is seeking the *initial job\u2011search* child\u2011care subsidy, she must meet the 12\u202fhrs/week employment requirement. If she cannot, she would need to enroll in a different program or seek additional employment hours.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA single\u2011mom who works part\u2011time **and** attends full\u2011time undergraduate courses can qualify for child\u2011care assistance through the education\u2011based eligibility pathway. She must (1) prove her full\u2011time status, (2) convert credit hours into weekly hours, (3) show her income is \u2264\u202f85\u202f% SMI, and (4) satisfy the 25\u2011hour total activity rule.

Child\u2011care hours required  \n\n| Family type | Minimum total child\u2011care hours per week | Minimum employment/training hours per week | Reference |\n|-------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Single\u2011parent | 25\u202fhrs (or 12\u202fhrs of employment) | 12\u202fhrs | [Doc\u202f1] |\n| Dual\u2011parent | 50\u202fhrs (or 25\u202fhrs of combined employment) | 25\u202fhrs combined | [Doc\u202f1] |\n| Any family (standard low\u2011income) | 25\u202fhrs (single\u2011parent) or 50\u202fhrs (two\u2011parent) | Not specified | [Doc\u202f2] |\n\n*If you are engaged in a job search, the family must be registered with the state labor\u2011exchange system (Work\u2011in\u2011Texas.com) and the child\u2011care hours must support that registration.*  \n\n---\n\n## 3.  Employment / job\u2011search requirements  \n\n| Situation | Requirement | Reference |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| Initial Job Search program | Parent(s) must be registered with Work\u2011in\u2011Texas.com; family must meet the hour requirements above | [Doc\u202f1] |\n| TANF applicant child\u2011care | Parent must receive an HHSC referral to a Workforce Orientation for Applicants (WOA), must have secured employment or increased earnings before the referral, and must be working at least 25\u202fhrs per week within 30\u202fdays prior to the referral | [Doc\u202f5] |\n| General low\u2011income program | Not explicitly required, but the child must need care so the parent can work or attend training | [Doc\u202f2] |\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Other considerations  \n\n* **Income sources excluded** from the family\u2019s monthly income calculation include Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, school meals, housing assistance, certain educational scholarships, tax refunds, etc. (See [Doc\u202f3]).  \n* **Termination**: If a family fails to meet the hour or employment requirements within three months, child\u2011care benefits must be terminated and the family must receive written notice. (See [Doc\u202f1]).  \n\n---\n\n## 6.  How to check your eligibility  \n\n1. **Calculate your family\u2019s monthly income** and compare it to 85\u202f% of the SMI for your household size.  \n2. **Count the child\u2011care hours you need** per week (25\u202fhrs for single\u2011parent, 50\u202fhrs for dual\u2011parent).  \n3. **Confirm your employment or training status**:  \n   * If you\u2019re in a job\u2011search program, register with Work\u2011in\u2011Texas.com.  \n   * If you\u2019re a TANF applicant, obtain the HHSC referral to WOA and meet the 25\u202fhrs/30\u2011day work requirement.  \n4. **Verify the child\u2019s eligibility** (age <13 or <19 with disability, living with the qualifying family).  \n5. **Submit the required documentation** (income statements, employment verification, WOA referral, etc.) to your local child\u2011care committee (Board).  \n6. **Receive written confirmation** of eligibility or denial.  \n\nIf any of the steps above are not met, you would not qualify for childcare assistance under the current Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) guidelines.  \n\n---  \n\n**Bottom line:**  \nYou qualify only if **all** the criteria above are satisfied.  If any one of them is missing\u2014such as income exceeding 85\u202f% of SMI, insufficient child\u2011care hours, lack of employment/training registration, or the child not meeting age/disability rules\u2014you would not be eligible for childcare assistance.

The single\u2011parent family\u2019s annual income of **$45,000** is below the $53,876.35 threshold \u2192 **income\u2011eligible**. |\n| 2 | **Child\u2011care hours** \u2013 At least an average of **25\u202fhours per week** of child care is required for single\u2011parent families (or 50\u202fhours for two\u2011parent families), or the parent must be engaged in job search or job training. | Doc\u202f5 \u2013 Child\u2011Care\u202fServices\u202fGuide (D\u2011200/D\u2011201) | The question does not specify hours or job\u2011search status. If the family can provide the required 25\u202fhours/week (or meet the job\u2011search criterion), the family would satisfy the hours requirement \u2192 **eligible**. If not, the family would **not** meet the full eligibility criteria. |\n\n**Bottom line**\n\n- **Income\u2011wise:** The family\u2019s $45,000 income is below the 85\u202f% SMI limit for a family of three in FY\u202f2023, so they **qualify** on the income side.  \n- **Hours\u2011wise:** They must also meet the 25\u2011hour/week requirement (or be in active job search/job training) to be fully eligible for Texas childcare assistance. If that requirement is met, the family would qualify for assistance; if not, they would not.  \n\n*I don\u2019t have information on whether the family meets the 25\u2011hour/week child\u2011care requirement.*",

Request** | The Board sends you a written request for the missing documentation. | Receive the request and review what is needed. | Within the 12\u2011month eligibility redetermination period. | [Doc\u202f1, Page\u202f81] |\n| **2. Submit** | You provide the requested documents (e.g., proof of identity, income statements, etc.). | Submit the documents either online, by mail, or in person, following the methods outlined in the application instructions. | As soon as possible; the Board will not issue a Notice of Eligibility until all required documents are received. | [Doc\u202f2, Page\u202f114] |\n| **3. Verification** | The Board verifies the documentation and ensures that your eligibility criteria are met. | If your identity information (SSN, name, DOB, gender) is incorrect, the Board may ask for proof from the list of acceptable documents (passport, driver\u2019s license, birth certificate, etc.). | Verification must be completed within 20 calendar days of receiving the completed application. | [Doc\u202f3, Page\u202f80] |\n| **4. Decision** | If all documents are accepted, the Board issues a Notice of Eligibility. If you fail to provide the needed documents, the Board may determine you are ineligible for CCS. | If you do not submit the documents, you risk an ineligibility determination. | No specific deadline beyond the 20\u2011day verification window; however, missing documents can lead to ineligibility. | [Doc\u202f1, Page\u202f81] |\n| **5. Fraud fact\u2011finding (if needed)** | If the Board suspects misuse of an SSN or identity data, it can initiate fraud fact\u2011finding during the 12\u2011month eligibility period or during the redetermination period and must report it to TWC\u2019s Office of Investigations. | Provide any additional evidence if requested. | Within five business days of discovering the discrepancy. | [Doc\u202f1, Page\u202f81] |\n\n**Bottom line:** After you submit your CCS application, the Board will let you know if anything is missing.
