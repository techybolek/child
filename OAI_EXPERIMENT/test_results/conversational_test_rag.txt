What percentage of SMI determines income eligibility for childcare assistance?

[Turn 1] Assistant:
Income eligibility for Texas childcare assistance is capped at **85 % of the State Median Income (SMI)**. This percentage is used to determine whether a family’s income allows them to qualify for low‑income child‑care benefits.  [Doc 3]

What is the current SMI dollar amount for a family of 4?

[Turn 2] Assistant:
The current State Median Income (SMI) dollar amount for a family of four in Texas is **$92,041**【Doc 1】.

(Response time: 5.36s)
----------------------------------------

[Turn 3] User:
Based on what you told me, calculate the exact income cutoff for that family.

[Turn 3] Assistant:
The income cutoff for a family of four is 85 % of the current State Median Income (SMI):

**$92,041 × 85 % = $78,235.85 (≈ $78,236)**

So the exact income cutoff for that family is **$78,236**.

If a family of 4 makes $4,500 per month, do they qualify?

[Turn 4] Reformulated:
Does a family of four earning $4,500 per month qualify for Texas childcare assistance?

[Turn 4] Assistant:
Yes.  

A family of four earning $4,500 per month ($54,000 per year) is below the 2026 income eligibility limit for a family of four, which is $7,670 per month (or $92,041 per year) for the Texas Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) program. Because the family’s income is under this threshold, they meet the income requirement for Texas childcare assistance.  

**Citations**  
- Monthly income limit for a family of four: $7,670 (Doc 2).  
- Eligibility rule that income must not exceed 85 % of the SMI: D‑200/D‑201 (Doc 4).

What is the current SMI dollar amount for a family of 4?

[Turn 2] Assistant:
The state‑wide median income (SMI) for a family of four in the 2026 board contract year is **$92,041** annually [Doc 1].

[Turn 3] User:
Calculate the exact income cutoff for that family.

[Turn 3] Assistant:
The income cutoff for a family of four is 85 % of the 2026 state‑wide median income (SMI).  
SMI for a family of four (2026 board contract year) = **$92,041** [Doc 1].

85 % of $92,041 = **$78,235.85** (rounded to the nearest dollar, $78,236).

So the annual income cutoff for that family is **$78,236**.

[Turn 4] Reformulated:
Does a family of four earning $4,500 per month qualify for Texas childcare assistance?

[Turn 4] Assistant:
Yes.  
The 2026 board contract year (BCY) income limits for a family of four are $92,041 annually or $7,670 per month. A family earning $4,500 per month is below the $7,670 monthly cap, so it meets the income eligibility requirement for Texas childcare assistance programs such as the Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) and Child Care Services (CCS) [Doc 2].

**Documents needed to verify a family’s income for Texas CCDF assistance**

| Source | Income type | Required documents |
|--------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Doc 2** (child‑care‑services‑guide‑twc.pdf, Page 71) | **Wage‑earning family members** | • Pay stubs covering the past three months if the member is paid monthly, or the past 12 weeks if paid weekly/bi‑weekly. The stubs must be consecutive.<br>• If the member is paid in cash, the employer must complete an **Employment/Income Verification Form** (or other Board‑defined employer verification). |
| **Doc 1** (child‑care‑services‑guide‑twc.pdf, Page 74) | **Self‑employed family members** | • Recent business bank statement.<br>• Recent business phone, utility, or insurance bill.<br>• Recent state sales tax return.<br>• Business records that prove income and expenses (e.g., copies of money orders or checks received, lists of customers served, or personal wage records with third‑party signed verification).<br>• Business registration or license (e.g., DBA license or Assumed Name Certificate). |
| **Doc 3 / Doc 4** (child‑care‑services‑guide‑twc.pdf, Pages 70‑71) | **New job or substantial earnings change** | • If a family member has started a new job or experienced a large earnings change and lacks pay documents, the **Employment/Income Verification Form** must be completed by the employer or provided by the Board. |

These documents are required for all family members who provide income that will be considered in determining CCDF eligibility.

What's the difference between CCS and CCMS?

[Turn 1] Assistant:
**CCS (Child Care Services)** is the Texas Workforce Commission’s (TWC) actual childcare‑subsidy program.  It is a public assistance program that provides financial support (subsidies) to families and is administered through local Workforce Development Boards and TWC staff.  The program has its own rules, eligibility criteria, income limits, payment procedures, and provider regulations.  

**CCMS (Child Care Management System)** is the computer system that boards and TWC use to track and manage each customer’s case.  The system holds the customer’s eligibility data, schedules, waiting‑list status, and any temporary changes to eligibility.  Boards use the CCMS to update a customer’s records and to perform case‑management functions such as contacting parents on the waiting list.  

In short: **CCS = the subsidy program; CCMS = the case‑management database that records and updates information for customers in the CCS program**.

[Turn 3] Assistant:
**Eligibility for a single‑mom, part‑time student**

| Item | What the policy says | How it applies to this mom |
|------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Income limit** | Family income must not exceed **85 % of the SMI**. | She must calculate her household income and show it is ≤ 85 % of SMI. |
| **Hours requirement** | Child care is required **if the parent works OR attends a job‑training/educational program** for **at least an average of 25 hrs/week** (for single‑parent families). | Her part‑time job *and/or* her student status can be used to meet the 25‑hr threshold. For each **credit hour** of post‑secondary undergraduate coursework she can count **3 hrs/week** (6 hrs/week for condensed courses). |
| **Cumulative limit** | Parents enrolled **full‑time** in a post‑secondary undergraduate program have a **cumulative 60‑month** limit on subsidy eligibility. Parents who are **both working and attending an educational program** are **not subject** to that limit. | Since she is **part‑time** in school and also works, she is *not* subject to the 60‑month cap. She can receive subsidy continuously as long as she keeps meeting the income and hours requirements. |

**Practical steps**

1. **Verify income** – provide recent pay stubs, tax returns, or self‑employment income documentation; calculate income as a percentage of SMI.  
2. **Document activity hours** – submit school transcripts or enrollment verification that show credit hours; convert those to hours per week using the 3‑hr/credit rule. Add any work hours.  
3. **Submit application** – complete the CCS application with the Board, including all required documentation.  
4. **Maintain eligibility** – keep records of any changes in work or school hours and report them at the 12‑month eligibility redetermination.  

**Bottom line**  
A single‑mom who is part‑time working **and** studying can qualify for Texas Child Care Services (CCS) as long as she meets the income cap and can demonstrate at least 25 hrs/week of required care (using school credit hours or work hours). She is not restricted by the 60‑month cumulative limit that applies only to full‑time undergraduate students.

I'm a single parent with 2 kids, making $35,000/year

[Turn 1] Assistant:
**Eligibility**

- For a family of 2 (one adult, two children) the 2026 Texas Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) income eligibility limit is **$62,588 per year**.  
- Your annual income of **$35,000** is below that limit, so you are **eligible for CCDF assistance** in 2026.  [Doc 2]

**Parent Share of Cost (PSoC)**  

| Income bracket | Monthly income (USD) | Monthly PSoC (1 child) | Monthly PSoC (2 children) | Weekly PSoC (1 child) | Weekly PSoC (2 children) |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| 35 % of SMI    | $2,148               | $92                    | $127                       | $21                   | $29                      |
| 45 % of SMI    | $2,762               | $136                   | $191                       | $31                   | $43                      |

Your monthly income of **$35,000 / 12 ≈ $2,917** falls between the 35 % and 45 % brackets.  CCDF policy uses the **upper bracket that the income is equal to or exceeds**, so your PSoC is calculated at the 45 % level.

**Result**

- **Monthly PSoC for 2 children:** **$191** (about **$2,292 per year**)  
- **Weekly PSoC for 2 children:** **$43**  

These amounts are well below the maximum parent share of cost for a family of 2, which is **$4,381 per year** (the upper limit shown in the first table).  [Doc 1]  

**Next steps**

1. **Verify your income** (e.g., provide W‑2s, pay stubs, or tax returns).  
2. **Complete a CCDF application** through your county’s child‑care assistance office or online portal.  
3. **Use the PSoC Calculator** or the chart above to confirm the exact monthly/weekly payment.  
4. **Submit the application** and await approval; once approved, you’ll receive a voucher to use at approved childcare providers.  

If you need help with the application or locating an approved provider, contact your local Department of Family and Protective Services office.

Do I qualify for childcare assistance?

[Turn 2] Assistant:
Yes – you meet the criteria to receive childcare assistance.

**Why you qualify**

1. **Income eligibility** – The Texas Workforce Commission’s Child Care Services Guide states that a family must have an annual income that does not exceed **85 % of the state median income (SMI)** to qualify for low‑income child care.  In the 2026 Texas Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) the 85 % SMI limit for a family of two (one adult + two children) is **$62,588 per year**.  Your reported income of **$35,000** is well below that threshold, so you satisfy the income test.  
   *Source: [Doc 1] (D‑200/D‑201 eligibility) and the provided context stating the $62,588 limit.*

2. **Activity / hours requirement** – As a single‑parent family, the guide requires **at least 25 hours per week of child care** so that the parent can work, attend training, or conduct a job search.  Since you are a single parent, you meet this requirement.  
   *Source: [Doc 1] (D‑200/D‑201).*

Because you meet both the income limit (85 % SMI) and the activity/hours requirement for a single‑parent family, you qualify for Texas childcare assistance under the CCDF program.

[Turn 3] Reformulated:
Would a single parent with 2 children earning $45,000 per year qualify for Texas childcare assistance?

[Turn 3] Assistant:
**Yes.**  
A single parent with two children earning $45,000 per year meets both of the key eligibility thresholds for Texas childcare assistance:

| Eligibility requirement | Calculation | Result |
|------------------------|-------------|--------|
| **Income cap (85 % of the State Median Income)** | 85 % × SMI for a family of 3 ( $63,391 ) = **$53,831** | $45,000 ≤ $53,831 – *within limit* |
| **Annual income eligibility limit for CCDF (2026)** | **$77,315** for a family of 3 (adult + 2 children) | $45,000 ≤ $77,315 – *within limit* |

Both criteria are satisfied, and the parent also meets the required child‑care hours (at least 25 hrs/week for a single‑parent family, as defined in D‑200).  

**Citations**  
- Income limit: *Texas Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) 2026* table, “Annual” column for family size 3 – $77,315 [Doc 2].

What happens after I submit my CCS application?

[Turn 1] Assistant:
After you submit your Child Care Services (CCS) application, the following steps occur:

1. **Eligibility verification** – Your local Workforce Development Board (with its child‑care contractor) reviews your completed application and all supporting documents. This verification must be completed within **20 calendar days** of receiving your application.  
   *[Doc 3]*

2. **Outcome notification** –  
   * **If you are not eligible**, the Board issues an ineligibility determination through the child‑care case management system and the process ends.  
   * **If you are eligible**, the Board issues a Notice of Eligibility from the case‑management system.  
   *[Doc 2]*

3. **Provider selection and program start** – Once you receive the Notice of Eligibility, you select a qualified provider. After you and the provider finalize the contract, your 12‑month CCS service period begins.  
   *[Doc 2]*  

In short: after submission, the Board verifies your application within 20 days, informs you of your eligibility status, and if eligible, you can then choose a provider and begin receiving childcare assistance.

[Turn 3] User:
What if they need more documents from me?

[Turn 3] Reformulated:
What if the local Workforce Development Board requires additional documents from me?

[Turn 3] Assistant:
If a local Workforce Development Board (the “Board”) asks you to submit additional paperwork, you should provide the documents the Board has indicated are acceptable for verifying the requested data.  
The Board’s procedure is:

1. **Request for documentation** – The Board will ask you to supply proof of the correct SSN, name, date‑of‑birth, or gender (or any other missing or incorrect information) using one of the documents listed in the Child Care Services Guide.  
2. **Submit acceptable identity documents** – You may provide any of the following (the list is not exhaustive; other “government‑issued identification” may be accepted as well):  
   * U.S. passport*  
   * State driver’s license*  
   * Government‑issued ID card*  
   * School ID card*  
   * Birth certificate  
   * Military or U.S. Coast Guard ID*  
   * Tribal document/card*  
   * Adoption papers or records*  
   * Employee ID card*  
   * Signed Medicaid application*  
   * Other documents such as TANF, SNAP, or foreign passport* (see [Doc 1] and [Doc 2]).

3. **Verification and system update** – Upon receipt, the Board verifies the documents, corrects the case‑management record, and enters the new data into the system.  
4. **If you do not respond** – The Board must still ensure the documentation is requested and submitted by you during the 12‑month eligibility redetermination process. They may also initiate fraud fact‑finding during this period if the discrepancy persists (see [Doc 3]).

So, simply provide one of the acceptable documents listed above, and the Board will verify and update your records accordingly. If you fail to submit the requested documents, the Board may take additional steps as described.

[Turn 4] User:
And after that?

[Turn 4] Reformulated:
What happens after I submit the additional documents requested by the local Workforce Development Board?

[Turn 4] Assistant:
After you send the additional paperwork that the local Workforce Development Board (the “Board”) requested, the Board will review that documentation as part of the eligibility‑verification process.  

1. **Verification of the supplied documents** – The Board must complete the eligibility verification within 20 calendar days of receiving your full application and any additional documents. The verification includes checking that the documents meet the Board’s acceptable‑document list and that they support the eligibility criteria you meet. [Doc 2]

2. **Issuing the outcome notice** – Once the Board finishes verification, it issues a Notice of Eligibility if you meet all requirements, or a Notice of Ineligibility if any required document is still missing or if you do not meet the eligibility thresholds. The Notice is the formal determination of whether you will receive Child Care Services (CCS). [Doc 2]

3. **Follow‑up actions** – If your eligibility is denied, the Board may notify you of the specific reasons and give you the opportunity to correct any issues. If the Board identifies any potential fraud (e.g., multiple uses of an SSN) during the review, it may initiate fraud‑fact‑finding and report the incident to the TWC Office of Investigations within five business days. [Doc 1]

4. **Continuity of service** – If you are found eligible, the Board will coordinate with the child‑care contractor to authorize and begin your CCS subsidy, and you can then enroll with a provider. If you are ineligible, the Board will provide information on how to appeal or seek assistance through other programs. [Doc 3]
