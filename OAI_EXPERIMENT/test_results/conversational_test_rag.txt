What percentage of SMI determines income eligibility for childcare assistance?

[Turn 1] Assistant:
Income eligibility for Texas childcare assistance is limited to families whose income does not exceed **85 % of the state median income (SMI)**.  

- This threshold is set in the Child Care Services Guide (D‑200/D‑201) and reiterated in the Child Care Workforce Strategic Plan 2023‑2025.

[Turn 4] User:
If a family of 4 makes $4,500 per month, do they qualify?

[Turn 4] Reformulated:
Does a family of four making $4,500 per month qualify for Texas childcare assistance?

[Turn 4] Assistant:
Yes.  
For a family of four the 2026 Texas Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) board‑contract year income limit is **$7,670 per month** (85 % of the state median income for that family size). A monthly income of **$4,500** is below this threshold, so the family meets the income eligibility requirement for Texas childcare assistance【Doc 2】.  

The eligibility rule is further defined in the Child Care Services Guide, where a family’s income must not exceed 85 % of the state median income (SMI) for the relevant family size【Doc 3】.

Wait, first tell me about Texas Rising Star

[Turn 2] Assistant:
**Texas Rising Star (TRS)**  
The Texas Rising Star program is a Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) initiative that certifies child‑care and early‑learning providers for quality performance. Its goal is to raise the standard of care for families that rely on subsidized child‑care services and to give providers a financial incentive to improve quality.

| Feature | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Quality‑improvement certification for providers that receive TWC‑funded Child Care Services (CCS). | [Doc 1] |
| **Certification Levels** | Two‑Star (meets some standards), Three‑Star (meets most standards), Four‑Star (meets nearly all standards). | [Doc 2] |
| **Reimbursement Incentives** | Enhanced reimbursement rates are set at least 5 % higher than base rates for Two‑Star, 7 % higher for Three‑Star, and 9 % higher for Four‑Star certified providers. | [Doc 1] |
| **Entry‑Level Designation** | Non‑certified providers were given 24 months to reach at least a Two‑Star certification. This was applied to 4,476 providers in 2022. | [Doc 3] |
| **Program Growth** | As of September 2022, 2,008 child‑care and early‑learning programs were Texas Rising Star‑certified, representing a 56 % increase since 2015 and about 31 % of all programs that accept subsidized children. | [Doc 3] |
| **Benefits to Families** | • Smaller class sizes and more teachers<br>• Positive, patient teachers<br>• Age‑appropriate activities and quality curriculum<br>• Support for learning at home<br>• Access to community resources | [Doc 5] |
| **How to Find a Certified Program** | Parents can visit the Texas Rising Star website (www.TexasRisingStar.org) or contact their local Workforce Development Board to locate and tour certified sites. | [Doc 4] |
| **Key Actors** | Texas Rising Star program (certifying agency) and the local Workforce Development Board (contact agency). | [Doc 2] |

In short, Texas Rising Star is a TWC‑backed quality certification that rewards providers with higher reimbursement rates, mandates participation for all regulated CCS providers, and offers families access to higher‑quality early‑learning environments.

What childcare programs require employment to qualify?

[Turn 1] Assistant:
**Child‑care programs that require the parent(s) to be employed (or actively seeking employment) to qualify:**

| Program | Employment requirement |
|---------|-------------------------|
| **Initial Job Search child‑care assistance** (a component of the Texas Workforce Commission’s Child Care Development Fund) | • A single‑parent family must have at least 12 hours of employment per week, and a dual‑parent family must have a combined 25 hours of employment per week.  <br>• Parents must be registered with the state’s labor‑exchange system and must maintain these activity hours for three months to keep the program active.  <br>• The case‑management system must record the need reason “Initial Job Search” and later “Working” if the activity requirements are met.  <br>• *Source:* Doc 1 and Doc 5. |
| **TANF applicant child‑care** (TANF – Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) | • The parent must be working (or have increased earnings) at least 25 hours per week within 30 days of the referral from HHSC.  <br>• Child care is authorized only when the parent is actively employed.  <br>• *Source:* Doc 2. |
| **Low‑Income child‑care** (under the CCDF) | • Child care is required for a parent to work or attend a job‑training or educational program, or the parent must be engaged in job search registration.  <br>• Income must not exceed 85 % of the SMI.  <br>• *Source:* Doc 4. |

These are the only programs in the provided documents that explicitly state an employment (or job‑search) requirement as part of the eligibility criteria.

[Turn 2] Reformulated:
Which Texas childcare programs do NOT require employment to qualify?

[Turn 2] Assistant:
**Child Care Programs in Texas that Do NOT Require Employment to Qualify**

| Program | Eligibility Feature |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Child Care during Initial Job Search** (D‑204) | Parents who are actively searching for a job can self‑attest that they do not meet the minimum participation requirements for Low‑Income child care and that their family income does not exceed 85 % of the State Median Income. Boards are instructed *not to collect income information or activity hours* for these parents, meaning employment status is **not required** for eligibility. | [Doc 1] |

No other Texas childcare assistance programs listed in the provided documents are specified as not requiring employment for qualification.

Of those, which have the highest income limits?

[Turn 3] Reformulated:
Which Texas childcare programs that do NOT require employment have the highest income limits?

[Turn 3] Assistant:
**Child‑care assistance program with the highest income limits (and that does not require the participant to be employed)**  

| Program | Highest income limit (2026 board‑contract year) | Family size for that limit | Source |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) | **$146,346** (annual income for a family of 15 members) | 15‑member family | [Doc 2] |

**Why CCDF is the highest‑limit program**

* The CCDF table lists the annual, monthly, weekly, bi‑monthly, and bi‑weekly income eligibility limits for families of 1–15 members. The highest figure appears in the row for a 15‑member family, which is **$146,346** for the 2026 board contract year.  
* The CCDF is a subsidized childcare assistance program that provides financial help to families regardless of whether the parents or caregivers are employed. The program’s purpose is to help families afford licensed childcare; it does not mandate employment as a condition of eligibility.

**Other programs**

* Provider Services Operational Consultation (PSOC) is a provider‑support program, not a family‑benefit program, so its income limits are not relevant to the question.  

Thus, among the Texas childcare assistance programs that do not require employment, the **Child Care Development Fund (CCDF)** has the highest income limits.

[Turn 3] Assistant:
**Documents required to verify income for each family member in a 6‑person household applying for CCDF assistance**

| Step | What the Board (child‑care committee) must collect | When it is required | Source |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | **Pay‑history documentation** – pay stubs (or other proof of wages) that cover the **most recent three months** (or 12 weeks if the member is paid biweekly). The pay information must be for **consecutive pay periods**. | For any family member who is an employee of the same employer for the entire three‑month period. | [Doc 2] |
| 2 | **Employment/Income Verification Form** (or a Board‑defined employer verification) | • If a family member is paid in cash. <br>• If the family member started a new job or experienced a substantial earnings change and does **not** have pay documents from that job. <br>• If the family member cannot provide three full months of pay documents and the year‑to‑date information does not cover the period being reviewed. | [Doc 3], [Doc 4] |

**Key points**

* The verification must be done for **every** family member who is employed (the entire household of six).  
* The pay‑history documents must be recent (within the past three months) and show consecutive pay periods.  
* If any member lacks such pay stubs, the Board must use the **Employment/Income Verification Form** to confirm the member’s earnings.  

These requirements apply only to the **family’s income**; they do not address provider‑side documentation.

What's the difference between CCS and CCMS?

[Turn 1] Assistant:
**CCS (Child Care Services)** is the Texas Workforce Commission program that provides childcare subsidies, sets eligibility rules, and manages payments to providers for families that qualify for the **CCS scholarship**. The program sets income limits, copay guidelines, and outlines parents’ rights and responsibilities when they apply for and receive subsidies [Doc 1].

**CCMS (Child Care Case Management System)** is the electronic system used by local child‑care Boards to enter, track, and update all authorization and eligibility information for families participating in CCS. CCMS is where Boards record authorization begin/end dates, income changes, and attendance records, and where they coordinate updates with TWC staff when parents report temporary changes [Doc 3][Doc 4].

In short:

|                     | CCS | CCMS |
|---------------------|-----|------|
| Purpose             | Subsidy program for families | System that Boards use to manage and record CCS authorizations |
| Function             | Sets eligibility, income limits, copays, and provider rules | Records authorizations, income changes, attendance, and updates for CCS customers |
| Who manages it      | Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) | Local child‑care Boards via the CCMS platform |
| Interaction          | Families apply and receive subsidies | Boards input and update data in the system |

Thus, CCS is the **program** that provides childcare assistance, while CCMS is the **case‑management tool** that local Boards use to administer that program.

Which one is better for a single mom working part-time?

[Turn 2] Assistant:
For a single mother who works part‑time, the Texas subsidized child‑care program is the most supportive option available.  The evaluation report shows that:

* **Employment outcomes:** 88 % of TANF parents and 87 % of non‑TANF parents secured or maintained jobs within 12 months of receiving subsidized child care.  In 2022 the rate for TANF parents was 92.70 % (Table 1A) and for non‑TANF parents the overall rate is 87 % [Doc 4, Doc 5].

* **Wage impact:** Non‑TANF parents experienced an average quarterly wage gain of $1,871 (≈$7,484 annually) after receiving child care, indicating a direct monetary benefit [Doc 5].

Because subsidized child‑care enables parents to remain employed and even increase earnings, it is the most effective support for a single mom working part‑time.  No other option in the documents provides comparable employment‑ or wage‑related evidence.

[Turn 3] Reformulated:
What if the single mom working part-time is also a student?

[Turn 3] Assistant:
**How a single‑mom who works part‑time and is a post‑secondary student can qualify for Texas child‑care assistance**

| Step | What the Board must do | Why it matters | Source |
|------|------------------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Verify that the parent is a **full‑time undergraduate student** (not a secondary‑school student). | Full‑time enrollment qualifies the parent for the *education‑based* child‑care eligibility rules, which allow the parent to meet the required hours through coursework. | [Doc 1] |
| 2 | Calculate the parent’s *education hours* by converting credit hours to weekly hours. | Each undergraduate credit hour equals **3 hours per week** (or 6 hours for condensed courses). These hours count toward the 25 hrs/week needed for single‑parent families. | [Doc 3] |
| 3 | Confirm the parent’s **income** is ≤ 85 % of the State Median Income (SMI). | The 85 % SMI cap is the income threshold for all low‑income child‑care programs. | [Doc 4] |
| 4 | Ensure the parent meets the **activity requirement**: at least 25 hrs/week of total activity (education + employment + other). | The Child Care Services Guide requires a single‑parent family to have a combined 25 hrs/week of activity; for *education* this is satisfied by the calculated hours. | [Doc 4] |
| 5 | If the parent also has **part‑time employment**, add those hours to the total activity. | Even part‑time work contributes to the 25‑hr minimum, but the *employment* requirement for initial job‑search child care (12 hrs/week) applies only to the *initial job‑search* program, not to the education‑based program. | [Doc 5] |
| 6 | Apply the **60‑month cumulative limit** for full‑time undergraduate education. | Boards must enforce a cumulative limit of 60 months (5 years) of education‑based assistance. Once the limit is reached, the parent reverts to standard eligibility (based on employment/education hours). | [Doc 1] |
| 7 | Treat any **temporary interruption** (e.g., family leave, sick leave, or a three‑month break) as an *eligible* period so long as income remains ≤ 85 % SMI. | The Board is instructed to consider children eligible during such interruptions, preventing a loss of benefits. | [Doc 2] |

### What happens if the mom’s part‑time work hours fall short of the required 12 hrs/week?

- **Education‑based program**: The parent can still qualify as long as the *combined* education and work hours reach 25 hrs/week and income ≤ 85 % SMI. The education hours are counted even if the parent is not meeting the 12 hrs employment requirement for the *initial job‑search* program.  
- **Initial Job‑Search program**: If the parent is seeking the *initial job‑search* child‑care subsidy, she must meet the 12 hrs/week employment requirement. If she cannot, she would need to enroll in a different program or seek additional employment hours.

### Bottom line

A single‑mom who works part‑time **and** attends full‑time undergraduate courses can qualify for child‑care assistance through the education‑based eligibility pathway. She must (1) prove her full‑time status, (2) convert credit hours into weekly hours, (3) show her income is ≤ 85 % SMI, and (4) satisfy the 25‑hour total activity rule. The 60‑month cumulative limit and rules for temporary interruptions are applied as described above.

I'm a single parent with 2 kids, making $35,000/year

[Turn 1] Assistant:
**Eligibility:**  
- The 2026 Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) income limit for a family of **2** is **$62,588 per year**.  
- Your annual income of **$35,000** is well below that threshold, so you are **eligible** for CCDF assistance. [Doc 1]

**Parent Share of Cost (PSoC):**  
- Your monthly income is $35,000 ÷ 12 ≈ $2,916.67.  
- In the 2026 sliding‑fee scale, a monthly income between **$2,762 and $3,375** (family size 2) places you in the *6th* bracket.  
- For **2 children**, the table lists a **monthly PSoC of $268** and a **weekly PSoC of $61** for that bracket. [Doc 4]

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Monthly PSoC (2 kids) | **$268** |
| Weekly PSoC (2 kids) | **$61** |

So, as a single parent with two children earning $35,000 a year, you qualify for CCDF assistance and would be expected to pay about $268 per month (≈ $61 per week) toward your childcare costs.

Do I qualify for childcare assistance?

[Turn 2] Assistant:
**Short answer**  
I can’t say for certain whether you qualify because I don’t have your income, family size, child‑care hours, or employment status.  To determine eligibility you must compare your situation against the criteria shown below.  

---

## 1.  Income limit  

| Program | Income ceiling | Reference |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Low‑income child‑care (standard “Low‑Income Child Care” and “Initial Job Search” programs) | **85 % of the State Median Income (SMI)** | [Doc 2] |
| TANF applicant child‑care | Same 85 % SMI rule (plus the additional employment requirements below) | [Doc 5] |

*The exact dollar amount depends on the SMI for the current year and your household size; the guide only specifies the percentage (85 % of SMI).*

---

## 2.  Child‑care hours required  

| Family type | Minimum total child‑care hours per week | Minimum employment/training hours per week | Reference |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Single‑parent | 25 hrs (or 12 hrs of employment) | 12 hrs | [Doc 1] |
| Dual‑parent | 50 hrs (or 25 hrs of combined employment) | 25 hrs combined | [Doc 1] |
| Any family (standard low‑income) | 25 hrs (single‑parent) or 50 hrs (two‑parent) | Not specified | [Doc 2] |

*If you are engaged in a job search, the family must be registered with the state labor‑exchange system (Work‑in‑Texas.com) and the child‑care hours must support that registration.*  

---

## 3.  Employment / job‑search requirements  

| Situation | Requirement | Reference |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Initial Job Search program | Parent(s) must be registered with Work‑in‑Texas.com; family must meet the hour requirements above | [Doc 1] |
| TANF applicant child‑care | Parent must receive an HHSC referral to a Workforce Orientation for Applicants (WOA), must have secured employment or increased earnings before the referral, and must be working at least 25 hrs per week within 30 days prior to the referral | [Doc 5] |
| General low‑income program | Not explicitly required, but the child must need care so the parent can work or attend training | [Doc 2] |

---

## 4.  Child eligibility criteria  

| Condition | Details | Reference |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Age or disability | Child must be <13 years or <19 years with a disability | [Doc 4] |
| Residence | Child must live with a family whose income ≤ 85 % SMI and with a parent who needs care to work or train | [Doc 4] |

---

## 5.  Other considerations  

* **Income sources excluded** from the family’s monthly income calculation include Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, school meals, housing assistance, certain educational scholarships, tax refunds, etc. (See [Doc 3]).  
* **Termination**: If a family fails to meet the hour or employment requirements within three months, child‑care benefits must be terminated and the family must receive written notice. (See [Doc 1]).  

---

## 6.  How to check your eligibility  

1. **Calculate your family’s monthly income** and compare it to 85 % of the SMI for your household size.  
2. **Count the child‑care hours you need** per week (25 hrs for single‑parent, 50 hrs for dual‑parent).  
3. **Confirm your employment or training status**:  
   * If you’re in a job‑search program, register with Work‑in‑Texas.com.  
   * If you’re a TANF applicant, obtain the HHSC referral to WOA and meet the 25 hrs/30‑day work requirement.  
4. **Verify the child’s eligibility** (age <13 or <19 with disability, living with the qualifying family).  
5. **Submit the required documentation** (income statements, employment verification, WOA referral, etc.) to your local child‑care committee (Board).  
6. **Receive written confirmation** of eligibility or denial.  

If any of the steps above are not met, you would not qualify for childcare assistance under the current Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) guidelines.  

---  

**Bottom line:**  
You qualify only if **all** the criteria above are satisfied.  If any one of them is missing—such as income exceeding 85 % of SMI, insufficient child‑care hours, lack of employment/training registration, or the child not meeting age/disability rules—you would not be eligible for childcare assistance.  To be sure, compare your personal facts to the table and steps above.

| 1 | **Income cap** – Family income must not exceed 85 % of the State Median Income (SMI) for the appropriate family size. | Doc 4 – Child‑Care Workforce Strategic Plan 2023‑2025 (p. 17) | The SMI for a family of three (parent + 2 children) in FY 2023 is **$63,391**. 85 % of that amount equals **$53,876.35**. The single‑parent family’s annual income of **$45,000** is below the $53,876.35 threshold → **income‑eligible**. |
| 2 | **Child‑care hours** – At least an average of **25 hours per week** of child care is required for single‑parent families (or 50 hours for two‑parent families), or the parent must be engaged in job search or job training. | Doc 5 – Child‑Care Services Guide (D‑200/D‑201) | The question does not specify hours or job‑search status. If the family can provide the required 25 hours/week (or meet the job‑search criterion), the family would satisfy the hours requirement → **eligible**. If not, the family would **not** meet the full eligibility criteria. |

**Bottom line**

- **Income‑wise:** The family’s $45,000 income is below the 85 % SMI limit for a family of three in FY 2023, so they **qualify** on the income side.  
- **Hours‑wise:** They must also meet the 25‑hour/week requirement (or be in active job search/job training) to be fully eligible for Texas childcare assistance. If that requirement is met, the family would qualify for assistance; if not, they would not.  

*I don’t have information on whether the family meets the 25‑hour/week child‑care requirement.*

What happens after I submit my CCS application?

[Turn 1] Assistant:
After you submit a Texas Child Care Services (CCS) application, the following sequence of actions takes place:

1. **Receipt and initial review** – The local Workforce Development Board (WDB) and its child‑care contractor receive your completed enrollment application (online or paper) and any required supporting documents.  
   *Cited: [Doc 1, Page 0] – “When will I find out if I am eligible?” and the 20‑day timeline.*

2. **Verification of eligibility** – Within 20 calendar days of receiving the complete application, the WDB verifies all eligibility criteria.  
   *Cited: [Doc 2, Page 113] – “Boards must ensure that verification of eligibility is completed within 20 calendar days.”*

3. **Issuance of a determination** –  
   * If you **are not eligible**, the Board issues a written determination of ineligibility and the process ends.  
   * If you **are eligible**, the Board issues an eligibility notification (a Notice of Eligibility) that authorizes you to use CCS benefits.  
   *Cited: [Doc 2, Page 113] – “If not eligible, Board issues determination … If eligible, Board issues eligibility notification.”*

4. **Selection of a provider and service start** – Once you have received the eligibility notification, you select an approved childcare provider. The selected provider then schedules you for services, and the first 12‑month period of subsidized childcare begins.  
   *Cited: [Doc 2, Page 113] – “Customer selects provider and 12 months of services begins.”*

5. **Ongoing compliance** – You must continue to provide any requested documentation for the next 12‑month redetermination period; otherwise, services can be denied or terminated.  
   *Cited: [Doc 4, Page 124] – “A parent’s failure to submit eligibility documentation will result in denial of CCS or termination of services.”*

In summary, after submitting your application, the local WDB will verify your eligibility within 20 days, issue a determination, and if you qualify, you will select a provider and begin receiving subsidized childcare services.

How long does that take?

[Turn 2] Reformulated:
How long does it take to process a Texas Child Care Services (CCS) application after submission?

[Turn 2] Assistant:
The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) requires that a local Workforce Development Board verify a child‑care application and issue a Notice of Eligibility within **20 calendar days** of receiving the completed enrollment application and all required supporting documents. This timeline applies to both first‑time and re‑application or recertification cases.  

- [Doc 1] states, “You will hear from us if you are eligible within 20 calendar days from when we received all your documents.”  
- [Doc 2] confirms that Boards must complete verification “within 20 calendar days of receipt of the completed Enrollment Application for CCS.”

What if they need more documents from me?

[Turn 3] Reformulated:
What if the local Workforce Development Board needs additional documents from me after I submit my CCS application?

[Turn 3] Assistant:
If a local Workforce Development Board (the child‑care **Board**) determines that your Child Care Services (CCS) application is missing information, it will formally request the additional documents. Here’s what happens next and what you need to do:

| Step | What the Board Does | What You Must Do | Timeframe | Key Doc(s) |
|------|---------------------|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **1. Request** | The Board sends you a written request for the missing documentation. | Receive the request and review what is needed. | Within the 12‑month eligibility redetermination period. | [Doc 1, Page 81] |
| **2. Submit** | You provide the requested documents (e.g., proof of identity, income statements, etc.). | Submit the documents either online, by mail, or in person, following the methods outlined in the application instructions. | As soon as possible; the Board will not issue a Notice of Eligibility until all required documents are received. | [Doc 2, Page 114] |
| **3. Verification** | The Board verifies the documentation and ensures that your eligibility criteria are met. | If your identity information (SSN, name, DOB, gender) is incorrect, the Board may ask for proof from the list of acceptable documents (passport, driver’s license, birth certificate, etc.). | Verification must be completed within 20 calendar days of receiving the completed application. | [Doc 3, Page 80] |
| **4. Decision** | If all documents are accepted, the Board issues a Notice of Eligibility. If you fail to provide the needed documents, the Board may determine you are ineligible for CCS. | If you do not submit the documents, you risk an ineligibility determination. | No specific deadline beyond the 20‑day verification window; however, missing documents can lead to ineligibility. | [Doc 1, Page 81] |
| **5. Fraud fact‑finding (if needed)** | If the Board suspects misuse of an SSN or identity data, it can initiate fraud fact‑finding during the 12‑month eligibility period or during the redetermination period and must report it to TWC’s Office of Investigations. | Provide any additional evidence if requested. | Within five business days of discovering the discrepancy. | [Doc 1, Page 81] |

**Bottom line:** After you submit your CCS application, the Board will let you know if anything is missing. You must submit the additional documents promptly; otherwise, the Board can withhold a Notice of Eligibility or even determine you are ineligible. Make sure the documents you provide match the acceptable identity documents listed in the Guide.

And after that?

[Turn 4] Reformulated:
What happens after I submit the additional documents requested for my CCS application?

[Turn 4] Assistant:
After you send the extra documents that the Board asked for, the local child‑care Board will:

1. **Verify the documents** – they check that what you sent meets the eligibility criteria.  
2. **Complete the eligibility determination** – the Board must make a determination within 20 calendar days of receiving the completed application and all required documents [Doc 2].  
3. **Issue a result** –  
   * If you meet the eligibility rules, the Board sends you a **Notice of Eligibility** from the case‑management system.  
   * If you do not meet the criteria, the Board issues a **determinination of ineligibility** and the process ends [Doc 3].  

4. **Proceed to provider selection** – once you have a Notice of Eligibility, you choose a licensed provider and the 12‑month Child Care Services period begins [Doc 3].
