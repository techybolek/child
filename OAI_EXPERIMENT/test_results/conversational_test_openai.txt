[Turn 2] User:
Wait, first tell me about Texas Rising Star

[Turn 2] Assistant:
Texas Rising Star is the quality rating system for child care programs that accept CCS, with providers designated as Entry Level or certified at Two-, Three-, or Four-Star based on meeting higher quality standards than minimum licensing.  Texas law now requires all regulated CCS providers to participate in Texas Rising Star, moving from Entry Level to at least Two-Star within set timeframes.  Certified Texas Rising Star programs receive enhanced CCS reimbursement rates (at least 5%, 7%, or 9% above base for Two-, Three-, or Four-Star), which helps incentivize and support higher quality.

TEST: Comparative Reasoning
Description: Tests comparison across entities with evolving constraints
----------------------------------------

[Turn 1] User:
What's the difference between CCS and CCMS?

[Turn 1] Assistant:
CCS refers to Texas Workforce Commission–funded child care subsidies and related quality activities for eligible families . 
“CCMS” isn’t defined in the provided materials; however, the files do reference a child care case management system (TX3C) used by Boards to process CCS applications and case actions . 
Do you mean CCMS as the case management system (TX3C), or something else?

(Response time: 31.34s)
----------------------------------------

[Turn 2] User:
Which one is better for a single mom working part-time?

[Turn 2] Assistant:
CCS is the actual child care assistance program that helps eligible parents who are working (including part-time) or in education/training pay for care; it’s the relevant option for a single mom working part-time if she meets income and other criteria  . 
“CCMS” refers to the child care case management system (e.g., TX3C) used to process CCS applications and cases—it’s not a benefit you choose between, so it isn’t comparable to CCS .

(Response time: 21.51s)
----------------------------------------

[Turn 3] User:
What if she's also a student?

[Turn 3] Assistant:
Yes—CCS counts parents who are working and/or enrolled in education or job training that leads to employment, so being a student in an eligible program can qualify alongside part-time work 【】. 
The CCS guide defines “attending a job training or educational program” as being officially enrolled, meeting attendance requirements, and showing progress toward completion, which satisfies the activity requirement 【】.

(Response time: 13.04s)
----------------------------------------

Success Criteria:
  - Compares both programs clearly
  - Applies part-time work constraint to recommendation
  - Adjusts recommendation with student status

TEST: Hypothetical Application
Description: Tests applying rules to specific user scenario
----------------------------------------

[Turn 1] User:
I'm a single parent with 2 kids, making $35,000/year

[Turn 1] Assistant:
You may qualify for Texas Child Care Services if you work/train an average of at least 25 hours per week (or are in an Initial Job Search period) and your income is at or below 85% of the state median income for a family of your size . At $35,000 for a family of three, you may be within the income limit, but I’d need your weekly work/training hours and your children’s ages to confirm eligibility . If eligible, you’ll have a parent share of cost on a sliding scale (generally up to 7% of income, with the first three months at $0 during Initial Job Search)  .

(Response time: 23.76s)
----------------------------------------

[Turn 2] User:
Do I qualify for childcare assistance?

[Turn 2] Assistant:
You may qualify if you work or attend training an average of at least 25 hours per week (or are in the Initial Job Search period) and your income is at or below 85% of the state median income for a family of three  . At $35,000/year you may be within the income limit, but I’d need your weekly work/training hours (or job-search status) to confirm; note that during the Initial Job Search period, copays are temporarily $0 if approved .

(Response time: 26.03s)
----------------------------------------

[Turn 3] User:
What if I get a raise to $45,000?

[Turn 3] Assistant:
A raise to $45,000 would not end your care unless it pushes your family’s income over 85% of the State Median Income (SMI) for a family of three; temporary increases of three months or less don’t affect eligibility, and longer increases are evaluated against the 85% SMI limit on an annualized basis . If you remain under the 85% SMI, your care continues through your 12‑month period; your parent share of cost is on a sliding scale based on income (capped at about 7% of income) and may be higher with a higher income .

(Response time: 20.8s)
----------------------------------------

Success Criteria:
  - Acknowledges user's specific situation
  - Applies eligibility rules to $35k scenario
  - Re-evaluates with $45k (not retrieves fresh)

TEST: Temporal Process Reasoning
Description: Tests tracking process sequence across turns
----------------------------------------

[Turn 1] User:
What happens after I submit my CCS application?

[Turn 1] Assistant:
After you submit a complete CCS application with all required documents, your local CCS office verifies eligibility (generally within 20 calendar days of receiving everything) and sends you a written notice of approval or denial; missing documentation can lead to a denial with appeal rights explained  . If approved, you choose a provider and your 12‑month eligibility period begins on the scheduled start date of care  .

(Response time: 33.15s)
----------------------------------------

[Turn 2] User:
How long does that take?

[Turn 2] Assistant:
About 20 calendar days after CCS receives your completed application and all required documents; you’ll be notified of your eligibility within that timeframe  .

(Response time: 10.99s)
----------------------------------------

[Turn 3] User:
What if they need more documents from me?

[Turn 3] Assistant:
If CCS asks for more documents, they can’t approve your case until all required documentation is received; failure to submit the requested eligibility documents can result in denial (you’ll get written notice with appeal rights) 【】【】. Verification is completed within 20 calendar days after CCS has your completed application and all required documents 【】.

(Response time: 8.65s)
----------------------------------------

[Turn 4] User:
And after that?

[Turn 4] Assistant:
After CCS gets the missing documents and finishes verification, you’ll receive a written eligibility decision; if you’re eligible, you choose a provider, CCS sends a Provider Authorization, and care starts on the scheduled start date, which begins your 12‑month eligibility period  . If you’re found ineligible, you’ll get a written denial with reasons and appeal rights .

(Response time: 10.72s)
----------------------------------------

Success Criteria:
  - Describes post-submission process
  - Resolves 'that' to review/processing step
  - Explains document request scenario
  - Continues sequence from document submission
