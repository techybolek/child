This will be assessed at the end of the fiscal year.\n14 | Capital Area | 4 | Health & Safety (except PD) | CPR, First Aid and AED Training was provided to Early Learning Program staff in the 4th Quarter. A total of 7 classes were conducted in the 4th Quarter, four in English and three in Spanish. 187 teachers participated and received their First Aid/CPR Certification during that time. $10,500 was spent in the 4th Quarter on these classes. | Ongoing | 187 | Our goal is to reduce the number of programs cited for 746.1315 -First AID and CPR Requirements by 50% at the end of FY23.\nOutcome: A total of 12 Early Learning Programs contracted with Capital Area were cited for 746.1315 in all of FY23. Of the 12 citations, 9 of them occurred prior to the June, with 3 of the citations occurring from July through September. This shows a decrease in citations within the last 4 months of FY23, however the goal of decreasing by 50% was not met. It is hard to determine the impact the CPR/First Aid classes played in this number, since the class information is shared with directors/owners and is reliant on directors then sharing class information with their staff. We will look to use a different measurable outcome next year that is easier to directly correlate to the class.\n14 | Capital Area | 4 | Evaluation & Assessment | CLASS Assessments were conducted in a total of twenty one (21) classrooms in Quarter 4 located within nine (9) separate Early Learning Programs . | Completed | 21 CLASS Assessment were conducted at 9 separate programs | We will measure success by seeing the average Category 2 scores of programs receiving Annual Monitoring's increase based on the previous year's scores. This will be assessed at the end of the fiscal year.\nOutcome: Of the 13 total programs that received a CLASS Assessment, only 5 of them saw an increase in their Category 2 scores on their next TRS assessment. With one program still waiting on their next assessment. It is worth noting not every classroom within these programs received a CLASS assessment and therefor it can be hard to correlate between CLASS assessments and Category 2 scores for the entire program. Future measurable outcomes will focus on the scores of the individual teachers receiving the CLASS assessment.\n14 | Capital Area | 4 | TRS/QRIS (except PD) | Early Learning Resources were purchased for our Texas Rising Star Two-Star, Three-Star, and Four-Star programs . These resources include toys, shelving and playground equipment with the goal of improving Category 4 scores for our TRS  Programs. In Quarter 4, a total of 15 Programs were purchased resources for a total of $7,695 was spent. (Note: some of these programs may be duplicate from prior quarters. Orders are shipped and then invoiced as available which leads to programs receiving resources over multiple quarters). | Completed | 15 Early Learning Programs | We will measure success with this activity by seeing a 10% increase in the number of TRS 3 and 4-star programs in FY2023. This will be assessed at the end of the fiscal year.\nOutcome: Workforce Solutions Capital Area went from a total of 130 TRS Three and Four Star programs at the beginning of FY23 to a total of 146 TRS Three and Four Star programs at the end of FY23. This is an increase of roughly 12% which meets this activities goals.\n14 | Capital Area | 4 | TRS/QRIS (except PD) | Texas Rising Star Implementation Grant.

This will be assessed at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nOutcome:  11  TRS programs were found to not meet Category 1  Met/Not Met measures  at their Annual Monitoring visit. A total of 103 Annual Monitoring visits were conducted in FY23 leading to  a rate of roughly 90% who avoided going on an SIA, slightly below our goal of 95%. We will look to review this measurable outcome for future years to determine if the percentage of the goal needs to be modified given the many factors that can contribute to a program being places on an SIA for Category 1.\n14 | Capital Area | 4 | Professional Development | 18 of scheduled subcontracted trainings were held in the 4th Quarter.

This will be assessed at the end of the fiscal year.\nOutcome: We compared the average Category 2 scores of FY22 for the Early Learning  Programs who sent staff to Conscious Discipline to the average Category 2 scores of the same programs across FY23. We saw a slight increase in the average Category 2 scores for those participating ELPs, from an average of 2.34 in FY22, to and average of 2.35 in FY23. Note some of the participating programs are not currently Texas Rising Star and therefor were not factored in to this data.\n14 | 4 | Capital Area | Professional Development | Director and Teacher Symposium. A multiple day, in-person Director and Teacher Symposium was conducted on August 4th and 5th. This symposium included multiple training sessions and speakers promoting best practices for child care center directors, owners, and teachers ranging from program administration to early childhood curriculum.

Our goal is to have 85% of staff receiving the Premium Pay Wage Supplement remain at their program.\nOutcome: A survey was given to wage supplement recipients 4 months after they received their award letter. At that time, 295 of the 343 recipients reported they were still employed at the same program. A rate of 86%, above the industry average. A follow up survey will be sent to all programs 6 months after recipients received their wage supplement payment, asking which of those staff are still employed at the program.\n14 | 4 | Capital Area | Evaluation & Assessment | CLASS Assessments were conducted in a total of twenty one (21) classrooms in Quarter 4 located within nine (9) separate Early Learning Programs . | Completed | 21 | We will measure success by seeing the average Category 2 scores of programs receiving Annual Monitoring increase based on the previous year's scores. This will be assessed at the end of the fiscal year.\nOutcome: Of the 13 total programs that received a CLASS Assessment, only 5 of them saw an increase in their Category 2 scores on their next Texas Rising Star assessment. With one program still waiting on their next assessment. It is worth noting not every classroom within these programs received a CLASS assessment and therefor it can be hard to correlate between CLASS assessments and Category 2 scores for the entire program. Future measurable outcomes will focus on the scores of the individual teachers receiving the CLASS assessment.\n14 | 4 | Capital Area | Texas Rising Star/QRIS (except PD) | Texas Rising Star Implementation Grant. Early Learning Resources were purchase for 3 Entry Level Designated programs actively working with Texas Rising Star Mentors to support achieving Texas Rising Star Certification.

The remainder are actively working with Texas Rising Star Mentors to become Texas Rising Star Certified. Purchasing for this program began in Quarter 3 of FY23, therefor all programs still have time within their 9 month window to become Texas Rising Star Certified . Therefor the full measurable outcome will not be known until the 3rd Quarter of FY24.\n14 | 4 | Capital Area | Texas Rising Star/QRIS (except PD) | Early Learning Resources were purchased for 15 Texas Rising Star Two-Star, Three-Star, and Four-Star programs .

In Quarter 4, a total of 15 Programs were purchased resources for a total of $7,695 was spent. (Note: some of these programs may be duplicate from prior quarters. Orders are shipped and then invoiced as available which leads to programs receiving resources over multiple quarters). | Completed | 15 | We will measure success with this activity by seeing a 10% increase in the number of Texas Rising Star 3 and 4-star programs in FY2023. This will be assessed at the end of the fiscal year.\nOutcome: Workforce Solutions Capital Area went from a total of 130 Texas Rising Star Three and Four Star programs at the beginning of FY23 to a total of 146 Texas Rising Star Three and Four Star programs at the end of FY23.

A total of 7 classes were conducted in the 4th Quarter, four in English and three in Spanish. 187 teachers participated and received their First Aid/CPR Certification during that time. $10,500 was spent in the 4th Quarter on these classes. | Ongoing | 187 | Our goal is to reduce the number of programs cited for 746.1315 -First AID and CPR Requirements by 50% at the end of FY23.\nOutcome: A total of 12 Early Learning Programs contracted with Capital Area were cited for 746.1315 in all of FY23. Of the 12 citations, 9 of them occurred prior to the June, with 3 of the citations occurring from July through September. This shows a decrease in citations within the last 4 months of FY23, however the goal of decreasing by 50% was not met. It is hard to determine the impact the CPR/First Aid classes played in this number, since the class information is shared with directors/owners and is reliant on directors then sharing class information with their staff. We will look to use a different measurable outcome next year that is easier to directly correlate to the class.\n14 | 4 | Capital Area | Texas Rising Star/QRIS (except PD) | Purchase Frog Street Curriculum for current Texas Rising Star Programs and Entry Level Programs actively working with a Texas Rising Star Mentor and who express interest in the TEA approved curriculum.
