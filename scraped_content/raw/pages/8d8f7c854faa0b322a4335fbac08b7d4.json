This shows a decrease in citations within the last 4 months of FY23, however the goal of decreasing by 50% was not met. It is hard to determine the impact the CPR/First Aid classes played in this number, since the class information is shared with directors/owners and is reliant on directors then sharing class information with their staff. We will look to use a different measurable outcome next year that is easier to directly correlate to the class.\n14 | Capital Area | 4 | Evaluation & Assessment | CLASS Assessments were conducted in a total of twenty one (21) classrooms in Quarter 4 located within nine (9) separate Early Learning Programs . | Completed | 21 CLASS Assessment were conducted at 9 separate programs | We will measure success by seeing the average Category 2 scores of programs receiving Annual Monitoring's increase based on the previous year's scores. This will be assessed at the end of the fiscal year.\nOutcome: Of the 13 total programs that received a CLASS Assessment, only 5 of them saw an increase in their Category 2 scores on their next TRS assessment. With one program still waiting on their next assessment. It is worth noting not every classroom within these programs received a CLASS assessment and therefor it can be hard to correlate between CLASS assessments and Category 2 scores for the entire program. Future measurable outcomes will focus on the scores of the individual teachers receiving the CLASS assessment.\n14 | Capital Area | 4 | TRS/QRIS (except PD) | Early Learning Resources were purchased for our Texas Rising Star Two-Star, Three-Star, and Four-Star programs . These resources include toys, shelving and playground equipment with the goal of improving Category 4 scores for our TRS  Programs. In Quarter 4, a total of 15 Programs were purchased resources for a total of $7,695 was spent. (Note: some of these programs may be duplicate from prior quarters. Orders are shipped and then invoiced as available which leads to programs receiving resources over multiple quarters). | Completed | 15 Early Learning Programs | We will measure success with this activity by seeing a 10% increase in the number of TRS 3 and 4-star programs in FY2023. This will be assessed at the end of the fiscal year.\nOutcome: Workforce Solutions Capital Area went from a total of 130 TRS Three and Four Star programs at the beginning of FY23 to a total of 146 TRS Three and Four Star programs at the end of FY23. This is an increase of roughly 12% which meets this activities goals.\n14 | Capital Area | 4 | TRS/QRIS (except PD) | Texas Rising Star Implementation Grant.

The remainder are actively working with TRS Mentors to become TRS Certified. Purchasing for this program began in Quarter 3 of FY23, therefor all programs still have time within their 9 month window to become TRS Certified .

This will be assessed at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nOutcome:  11  TRS programs were found to not meet Category 1  Met/Not Met measures  at their Annual Monitoring visit. A total of 103 Annual Monitoring visits were conducted in FY23 leading to  a rate of roughly 90% who avoided going on an SIA, slightly below our goal of 95%. We will look to review this measurable outcome for future years to determine if the percentage of the goal needs to be modified given the many factors that can contribute to a program being places on an SIA for Category 1.\n14 | Capital Area | 4 | Professional Development | 18 of scheduled subcontracted trainings were held in the 4th Quarter.

We created a combined total of 37 new slots (25 new infant slots and 12 new toddler slots) with 3 Programs | Completed | 3 | WFSCB experienced adequate success in achieving this goal at 38% by creating 3 of our targeted goal of 8 new infant and toddler classrooms during BCY2024. WFSCB was 125% successful in creating the number of new infant slots for the combined classroom totals, but fell short at 30% in creating the number of new toddler slots in BCY2024.   WFSCB had a 61.7% success rate in creating 37 out of the 60 combined infant and toddler \"new\" slots.  The infant/toddler expansion project will remain as one of the Board's quality initiatives in BCY2025 because it increases capacity and allows WFSCB to serve more infant and toddler children in the Board's 11-county region.\n22 | 4 | Coastal Bend | Infant & Toddler | Early Literacy Initiative for Infants.  WFSCB purchased/distributed 130 sets of \"soft\" cloth and \"board\" books in infant classrooms at 79 Texas Rising Star Entry Level designated child care centers and home providers during the fourth quarter. The titles of these books were \"Pets\", \"Animals\", \"Numbers\", \"Shapes\", \"Vehicles\", and \"Baby's First Words\". The books will be used by the infants during \"tummy\" time which will enable them to develop their sensory skills and \"hand-eye\" coordination. | Completed | 79 | WFSCB achieved 48% of its goal to place sets of \"soft\" and \"board\" books in all (164 child care providers and home providers) of the infant classrooms/home providers.  We will survey these child care providers during the first quarter of BCY2025 to determine how the infants in these classrooms are progressing towards these developmental milestones.  While we feel that assisting infants in developing their sensory skills and \"hand-eye\" coordination are very important developmental milestones, WFSCB will not continue this initiative in BCY2025 due to less than 50% of the child care providers' responding to our survey for interest in this initiative.\n22 | 4 | Coastal Bend | Infant & Toddler | Early Literacy Initiative for Toddlers.  WFSCB purchased/distributed the CELEBRATE \"Sing and Read\" curriculum kits for 36 home providers during the fourth quarter.

We will survey these child care providers during the first quarter of BCY2025 to determine how the toddlers at these home child care providers are progressing with letter recognition and in their phonemic awareness skills.  The progress these children make with respect to these objectives will determine whether or not WFSCB will continue this initiative in BCY2025.\n22 | 4 | Coastal Bend | Other (Shared Services, Pre-K Partnerships) | Staff Retention Bonuses (Wage Supplements).

The rationale for providing the staff retention bonuses to the child care center employees is to \"thank them\" for having been employed at their current child care center for at least six months and encourage them to remain at their current places of employment for longer periods of time.  WFSCB gave 886 staff retention bonuses to child care employees at 131 licensed child care centers and homes during the fourth quarter. | Completed | 886 | WFSCB gave staff retention bonuses to child care employees at 80% of its targeted goal of 164 licensed child care centers and homes during the fourth quarter of BCY2024.

WFSCB placed Frogstreet age-appropriate curriculum kits in infant, toddler, three-year old, and Pre-Kindergarten classrooms at 33 Texas Rising Star Entry Level designated child care centers during the fourth quarter. WFSCB's expectation is/was that the child care staff in these classrooms would receive a minimum score of  \"2\" in the \"warm responsive\" category on the initial Texas Rising Star assessment. A score of \"2\" or higher would enable a child care provider to hopefully achieve a Texas Rising Star star level of \"3\" or \"4\" on the completed assessment. This would ensure that the child care staff are engaging with/providing quality responses and interactions to the children they are caring for. | Completed | 33 | WFSCB achieved 55% of its goal of placing Frogstreet age-appropriate curriculum kits in the infant, toddler, three-year, and Pre-Kindergarten classrooms at its target of 60 Texas Rising Star Entry Level Designation child care centers during the BCY2024 contract year. (This outcome was revised to indicate that an extension waiver was requested and granted for our Texas Rising Star Entry Level Designation child care providers (who were required to be Texas Rising Star certified by 09-30-2024) due to circumstances that were outside of the providers control.)  WFSCB will continue to provide Frogstreet age-appropriate curriculum kits to our new Entry Level Designated child care providers during BCY2025.
