Often many trainings are aimed at pre-school aged children and leave out the important role of caring and educating infants and toddler. We will look to host a total of 6 Infant/Toddler specific trainings throughout Quarters 2, 3 and 4. Sessions will be conducted by subject matter experts to provide infant/toddler specialized training. This activities aligns with our survey results which showed training and professional development as the most requested quality activity for the coming year. \nTarget Audience: We estimate 75 teachers will participate in infant/toddler specific trainings offered throughout FY2025. \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by reaching 95% of our 75 attendance target over FY2025 for Infant/Toddler specific trainings.\nInfant & Toddler Outdoor Enhancement Grant | CCQ 2% | 245000 | Quarter 2 | Activity: Infant/Toddler Outdoor Enhancement Grant - Too often infants and toddlers are not considered when designing or planning an outdoor playground or learning space. This leads to minimal opportunities for infants and toddlers to have a safe, developmentally appropriate place outside to explore and learn. Capital Area will offer an Infant/Toddler Outdoor Enhancement Grant to encourage programs to get their infants and toddlers outside more. \nThis project aligns with the need expressed by Teacher and Directors for additional materials and resources, which was one of the top requests in our August survey.

Most sessions are conducted by subject matter experts to provide specialized training on topics identified through a needs survey of early learning programs. Trainings will be offered in every quarter throughout FY2025.\nTarget Audience: an estimated reach of 1,500 early childhood directors and teachers. \nMeasurable Outcome: Workforce Solutions Capital Area will measure success by reaching 95% of our 1,500 individuals certificates issued target. The certificates will be issues and tracked through the Texas Workforce Registry (TECPDS) thereby encouraging early learning staff to create or maintain TECPDS accounts.\nConscious Discipline Training | CCQ 2% | 85000 | Quarter 2 | Activity: Conscious Discipline Training - Offering Conscious Discipline Trainings align our programs with local school districts to ensure a smooth transition and aligns programs with Frog Street Curriculum. A focus on social-emotional development will also help educate teachers to work with children of all abilities. In our August survey, Teacher/Child Interactions and Conscious Discipline were the top two requested training topics, aligning this activity with the needs of our programs.  In review of Texas Rising Star Assessment Data over the past two plus years (2022-present), Category 2 scores were lowest on average compared to the other three Texas Rising Star categories. We also saw a decline in Category 2 scores year over year from 2022 through September 2024 (2022- avg. 2.32, 2023 - average 2.19, 2024- average 2.10). This training will support teachers and programs in increasing their Category 2 scores. We anticipate offering a total of two director trainings and 4 teachers trainings (two in English, two in Spanish) in Quarters 2, 3, and 4. \nTarget Audience: Our goal is to provide training to 200 early learning staff across all trainings. \nMeasurable Outcome: In the post class evaluation, we will measure success by seeing at least 80% of participants indicate that the class was \"Beneficial\". We will also see an increase in Category 2 scores.\nDirector Credential Course | CCQ 2%\n\nOTHER | 15000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Director Credential Course - Capital Area will offer a Texas Health & Human Services Commission-Child Care Licensing recognized Director Credential Course.

This credential can be used as the education portion of a staff's application with Child Care Regulation to become a director in the State of Texas. This course directly helps meet the continued need of early learning programs for educated, qualified directors. It also aligns with our survey results, which showed directors ranking \"Support for Child Care Workforce\" as the number one Quality Activity they would like to see in FY2025. Data gathered in FY2024 helps supports the need for this project. Based on the staffing data submitted by contract programs of current staff working at early learning programs, we saw Full-Time teacher turn-over rates on average of 22.90% in FY24. This is slightly above the state average turnover rate of 20% (https://texestest.org/texas-early-education-turnover-rate/). This project will help ensure qualified staff can fill the role of administrators as turnover continues within our industry. \nTarget Audience: We anticipate enrolling 25 participants for this class, which will take place in Quarter 3. \nMeasurable Outcomes: We will measure success by seeing 80% of participants who complete the course will go on to receive their Director Credential.\nFrog Street Curriculum Training | CQF 4% | 16000 | Quarter 4 | Activity: Frog Street Curriculum Training - We will provide training on Frog Street Curriculum which was purchased to support Texas Rising Star-certified programs and those actively working to become certified. Frogstreet Curriculum is a comprehensive, research-based program that integrates instruction across all developmental domains. The curriculum will be available from infant to Pre-kindergarten in both Spanish and English. This activity is supported by the survey results which notes teachers overwhelmingly requested additional support specific to managing challenging behaviors. With Frog Street Curriculum integrating Conscious Discipline within the curriculum, we believe this curriculum will assist with this expressed need. The curriculum will also assist with programs achieving and maintaining their Texas Rising Star Certification. In review of Texas Rising Star Assessment Data over the past two plus years (2022-present), Category 2 scores were lowest on average compared to the other three Texas Rising Star categories. We also saw a decline in Category 2 scores year over year from 2022 through September 2024 ( 2022- average 2.32, 2023 - average 2.19, 2024- average 2.10). The Frog Street training will assist new and current programs utilizing Frog Street Curriculum with ensuring staff know how to plan and implement the curriculum. We anticipate holding two director implementation trainings and 6 Teacher implementation trainings through Fiscal Year 2025. \nTarget Audience: We estimate a total of 20 directors and 40 teachers participating in a Frog Street Implementation Training in FY2025. \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by seeing 90% of current Texas Rising Star-certified programs maintain their certification through FY2025, while we will look to see an overall increase in new certified programs throughout FY2025.\n\nUpdate Q3: Funding decreased from $50,000 to $16,000 due to lower than anticipated training costs. Funding ($34,000) from this activity was reallocated to  the Jeannette Watson Wage Supplement and Staff Retention Incentive activity lines.\nSpanish CDA Course | CQF 4% | 45000 | Quarter 2 | Activity: Spanish CDA Course - While there are multiple resources and opportunities available for early childhood staff to work toward their CDA in English, such as through CLI Engage, few opportunities exist for staff whose primary language is Spanish. Based on surveys conducted for our CCS programs, a continued request was to offer a CDA course for Spanish speaking staff. This also aligns with our Survey results, showing training and professional development as the top priority quality activity staff would like to see this year. Support for CDA specifically ranked in the top 5 of survey responses. In review of the Texas Rising Star Assessment data over the past two plus years, we have seen a steady decline in Category 1 scores from 2022 to present (2022- average 2.38, 2023 - average. 2.33, 2024- average 1.98). This course will assist staff in achieving a CDA which in turn can lead to higher Category 1 scores. Workforce Solutions Capital Area will look to provide two CDA courses, starting in Quarter 2.\nTarget Audience: 20 Early Childhood Professionals participating in each course. \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by seeing 85% of participants complete the course and receive all of the training hours needed to apply for their CDA Credential. \n\nUpdate Q3: Funding switched from CCQ to CQF due to the need to ensure adequate funding was available for other activities, and lower than projected costs of the Spanish CDA Course.\nPBS Childcare Partnership Program | CCQ 2% | 53340 | Quarter 1 | Activity: PBS Childcare Partnership Program - Capital Area will partner with PBS Kids to support early learning programs serving CCS families by providing PBS Kids resources to support quality learning.

This project will award classroom materials, furniture and other developmental resources required for maintaining quality-rating certification. This activity is designed to ensure a continued healthy supply of quality early learning programs within Travis County to meet the demand of parents needing child care to work or continue their education. When surveying teachers what supports would enhance their classroom environment and contribute to their success, more resources for educational supplies and materials was the second most requested item behind professional development. Resources and materials was also one of the top five ranked items for activities they wish to see occur in FY2025. In review of Texas Rising Star Assessment Data, we have seen a fairly large drop in Category 4 scores as more initial Entry Level Designated programs get assessed. These programs have not traditionally received material support from Capital Area and therefor would benefit from additional resources. In 2023, the average category 4 score was 2.63. That number has decrease to 2.24 as of September, 2024. Additional resources will support programs with increasing their Category 4 scores. \nTarget Audience: We estimate 200 early learning programs will receive these resources in FY2025. \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by seeing an increase in the average Category 4 scores throughout FY2025. Over the past year, Capital Area programs assessed through Texas Rising Star received an average Category 4 score of 2.35. We will look to see an increase in that average over FY2025.\nFrog Street Curriculum | CQF 4% | 10000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Frog Street Curriculum - We will offer to purchase Frog Street Curriculum to Texas Rising Star-certified child care programs and those actively working to become Texas Rising Star. Frogstreet Curriculum is a comprehensive, research-based program that integrates instruction across all developmental domains. The curriculum will be available from infant to Pre-kindergarten in both Spanish and English. This activity is supported by the survey results which lists \"More resources for educational materials and supplies\" as the second most requested resource for classrooms. Teachers also overwhelmingly requested additional support specific to managing challenging behaviors. With Frog Street Curriculum integrating Conscious Discipline within the curriculum, we believe this curriculum will assist with this expressed need. Workforce Solutions Capital Area will extend access to the Frog Street LilyPad online portal for early learning programs who previously received Frog Street Curriculum from WFSCA. This will ensure programs will be able to continue to implement the curriculum for an additional year.  This will also assist with programs achieving and maintaining their Texas Rising Star Certification. In review of Texas Rising Star Assessment Data over the past two plus years (2022-present), Category 3 scores declined year over year from 2022 through September 2024 ( 2022- average 2.68, 2023 - average  2.65, 2024- average  2.40). The continued use of curriculum will support teachers and programs in increasing their Category 3 scores in both P-PM-03 and P-PM-04. \nTarget Audience: We anticipate purchasing curriculum for 25 early learning programs through Fiscal Year 2025.  We anticipate purchasing 50 licenses for programs currently using Frog Street Curriculum purchased by Workforce Solutions Capital Area.  \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by seeing 90% of current Texas Rising Star-certified programs maintain their certification through FY2025, while we will look to see an overall increase in new Texas Rising Star-certified programs throughout FY2025.\n\nUpdate Q2: Quarter start date was changed from Q2 to Q3.\nUpdate Q3: Funding for this activity decreased from $250,000 to $10,000 due to higher than anticipated demand for wage supplement activities. Funding from this activity has been reallocated to the Jeannette Watson Wage Supplement and Texas Rising Star Staff Personnel activity lines.\nParent Training | CCQ  2%            & CQF 4% | 40000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Parent Training - A series of conversations and trainings with parents in the CCS program will be conducted throughout FY2025. The topics will be determined with input from child care programs and the Early Care and Education Specialists. The format of these trainings will be virtual to best meet the needs of parents. Cost will include gift cards and/or resources for parents who participate in the trainings. Through collaboration with our community partners, Workforce Solutions Capital Area wishes to connect with all stakeholders in the services we provide. This includes the families we serve through the Child Care Scholarship program. Parent trainings allow us to provide relevant child development trainings for parents, engage them in conversations, and solicit feedback on how we can continue to improve our services. We believe the more parents learn about child development and quality early childhood education, the more empowered they will feel to select a quality early learning program when searching for child care. We will hold the parent trainings in Quarters 3 and 4. \nTarget Audience: anticipated 150 parents participating. \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by reaching 95% of our 150 target of parents attending one of our training opportunities. \n$25,000 of CQF funding and $15,000 of CCQ funding\n\nUpdate Q3: CQF funding ($25,000) was added from the Curriculum activity. CCQ funding was decreased from $20,000 to $15,000. This activity decreased in funding from $50,000 to $40,000 due to lower than projected overall training costs. The funding from this activity was reallocated to the Jeannette Watson Wage Supplement activity line.\nTexas Rising Star Banners | CCQ 2% | 1000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Texas Rising Star Banners - Updated Texas Rising Star banners/materials for programs achieving Texas Rising Star certification. The goal is to help inform parents and community partners about the Texas Rising Star program and to encourage enrollment in quality child care programs. Texas Rising Star Banners will help inform parents on quality child care options they have available to them. While all CCS programs are working toward Texas Rising Star certification, this activity aligns with our community partners and the Success by 6 Strategic Plan for Austin/Travis County. Two separate orders will be place, one in Quarter 1 for the programs who achieved Texas Rising Star certification in FY24, and another order will be placed in Quarter 4 to account for the additional programs expecting to be assessed throughout FY2025. \nTarget Audience: We estimate 50 early learning programs will receive Texas Rising Star Banners in FY2025. \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by looking at the number of CCS children attending a Texas Rising Star-certified center at the start of FY2025 and compare to the number of CCS children attending Texas Rising Star-certified centers at the end of FY2025, looking to see an increase in that number. \n\nUpdate Q3: Funding for this activity decreased from $2,600 to $1,000 due to lower costs than projected. Funding from this activity was reallocated to CLASS Assessment Certification activity line.\nCLASS Assessment Certification for Texas Rising Star Staff | CCQ 2% | 5000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: Class Assessment Certifications - Workforce Solutions Capital Area will continue to renew CLASS Certifications for our Texas Rising Star mentor staff. Giving our Texas Rising Star mentors the tools they need to coach and mentor early learning programs to Texas Rising Star Certification will help ensure we have the child care capacity needed to support our CCS families and the families of Central Texas more broadly. \nTarget Audience: We anticipate 4 Texas Rising Star mentors will maintain their CLASS Certification throughout FY2025. \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by seeing 90% of current Texas Rising Star-certified programs maintain their Texas Rising Star certification through FY2025, while we will look to see an overall increase in new Texas Rising Star-certified programs throughout FY2025.\n\nUpdate Q3: Funding for this activity increased from $4,000 to $5,000 due to new staff needing to become CLASS Certified. The increase in funding came from the Texas Rising Star Banner activity.\nInclusion Resources for Children with Special Needs | CQF 4%\n\nOTHER | 25000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Inclusion Resources for Children with Special Needs - We will offer inclusion resources for programs who have requested a consultation or training from our Workforce Solutions Capital Area Inclusion Specialist. These resources will be selected by the Inclusion Specialist and Family Services team specifically for the program based on conversations and observations conducted. A survey are Early Childhood Staff showed the number one requested support by teachers was a need for assistance with \"managing challenging behaviors\". These resources and the support from the Capital Area Inclusion Specialist will assist teachers with this need and align with the Workforce Solutions Capital Area goal of minimizing expulsions of children within CCS programs. In review of the data from our CCS children marked as having a disability in TWIST, we determined that 4 of the 112 children were expelled from their early learning program in FY 2024. While this number is relatively low, Capital Area and our community partners will strive for no child with a disability to be expelled from their program. These inclusion resources as well as the support from our Inclusion Specialist, will assist with achieving this goal. \nTarget Audience: We anticipate purchasing resources for 20 early learning programs depending on their specific needs, and will begin this project in Quarter 2. \n$50,000 $5,000 of the funding for this project will come out of CQF 4% with an additional $20,000 coming from community partners (City/County). \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by tracking the number of CCS child expulsions throughout FY2025, with the goal of seeing an overall decrease from FY2024.\nUpdate Q3: Funding for this activity decreased from $70,000 to $25,000 due to higher than anticipated demand for wage supplement activities. Funding from this activity has been reallocated to the Jeannette Watson Wage Supplement and Staff Retention Incentive activity lines..\nTexas Rising Star and Industry Support Specialist Staff | CCM | 0 | Quarter 1 | Activity: Capital Area will employ an additional Texas Rising Star mentor as well as retain our Industry Support Specialist who serves as both a TECPDS Subject Matter Expect and Infant/Toddler Specialist while assisting early learning programs with TECPDS implementation as supporting mentors with documentation review. (1 Mentor FTE, 1 Other FTE) \nTarget Audience: We will provide Texas Rising Star mentoring, Workforce Registry, and Infant/Toddler support to 349 CCS early learning programs. \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by reaching 95% of our 349 target of CCS programs receiving mentoring visits throughout FY2025. \n\nUpdate Q3: This activity was removed because CCM funding is no longer being utilized for Mentor or Industry Support Staff positions.\nTexas Rising Star Staff Personnel | CCQ 2% | 215402 | Quarter 1 | Activity: Capital Area will look to maintain our current Texas Rising Star mentor staff (12.5 FTEs) in order to continue working with both certified and Entry Level designated programs. We will also look to retain our Industry Support Specialist who serves as both a TECPDS Subject Matter Expect and Infant/Toddler Specialist while assisting early learning programs with TECPDS implementation as supporting mentors with documentation review. This aligns with Workforce Solutions Capital Area and community partner's strategic plan of ensuring children and families in Travis County are able to access high-quality early learning programs. By expanding the number of Texas Rising Star-certified early learning programs, we will assist with meeting this need. \nTarget Audience: We will provide Texas Rising Star mentoring and support to 349 CCS early learning programs. \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by reaching 95% of our 349 target of CCS programs receiving mentoring visits throughout FY2025.\n\nUpdate Q3: Funding for this activity increased from $185,943 to $215,402 due to higher than anticipated mentor personnel costs. Funding for this activity was reallocated from the Curriculum activity.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 1046402\nSupporting Health & Safety Standards (except Professional Development)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nCPR/First Aid | CCQ 2% | 27000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: CPR/First Aid - In a survey, child care programs identified the need for in-person CPR/First Aid training courses. We have utilized last years data, identifying CPR/First Aid Training as one of the most consistent and well-attended trainings that we offer, showing a continued need and interest in this training. Workforce Solutions Capital Area offering First Aid/CPR on a regular basis assists programs with ensuring their staff are CPR/First Aid certified which aligns with our goal of having a qualified and supported early childhood workforce. We will be providing CPR/First Aid monthly beginning in Quarter 1 and going throughout FY2025. \nTarget Audience: Each class will hold up to 50 teachers with a number of classes available in Spanish as well. We estimate 300 early learning staff will participate in a First Aid/CPR class in FY2025. \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by reaching 95% of our 300  target of early learning staff attending and receiving their CPR/First Aid certification.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 27000\nEvaluation & Assessment (tools to measure effective practice or child development/progress)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nTeaching Strategies GOLD Assessment | CCQ 2% | 10000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Teaching Strategies GOLD Assessment - Teaching Strategies GOLD is a formal assessment tool used by many early learning programs to assist with assessing children within their classrooms. Many programs began utilizing Teaching Strategies GOLD when it was offered through a state initiative for free. With Child Screenings now a required measure for Texas Rising Star, we view this support as a way to further ensure Texas Rising Star success. Capital Area signed a letter of commitment with Teaching Strategies during the latest TWC grant to support programs utilizing the GOLD Assessment with sustainability. This activity would help meet that commitment and further support those utilizing GOLD. \nTarget Audience: We estimate assisting 12 programs extend their GOLD Subscriptions in Quarters 3 and 4. \nMeasurable Outcome: Due to the utilizing of child screenings being a scored measure in Texas Rising Star, we will look to see 90% of those who were purchased the GOLD Assessment will maintain their Texas Rising Star certification in FY2025.\nAges and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) | CCQ 2% | 1000 | Quarter 4 | Activity: Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) - Capital Area will continue offering the ASQ-3 and ASQ-SE2 screening to parents and programs participating in the CCS program. This will include continuing the ASQ questionnaire subscription as well as electronic storage of questionnaire results for fast and secure answer storage. The ASQ is an evidence-based developmental and social-emotional screening for children from one month to 5 1/2 years of age. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire will assist Capital Area with our goal that all children have the support they need to thrive in an early childhood program setting. This activity will assist with identifying potential delays at an early age, so staff can connect families to resources to ensure their child is able thrive along with their peers. \nTarget Audience: We anticipate working with 10 early learning programs on implementing ASQ in their programs. While the ASQ renewal will be paid for in Quarter 4, we anticipate working with programs starting in Quarter 1. \nMeasurable Outcome: Due to the utilizing of child screenings being a scored measure in Texas Rising Star, we will look to see 90% of those who were provided ASQ training and access will maintain their Texas Rising Star certification in FY2025.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 11000\nSupporting National Accreditation\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nNational Accreditation Fee Scholarships | CQF 4% | 16500 | Quarter 1 | Activity: National Accreditation Fee Scholarships - Programs will be eligible to apply for grants to cover their annual National Accreditation fees. This would include fees for any Texas Rising Star-recognized National Accreditation entity to include NAEYC, NAC, and Advanced ED/Cognia. Support for programs who are currently Nationally Accredited or working toward National Accreditation will assist with the supply of quality child care programs within our area. This will also assist programs who seek to maintain or gain Texas Rising Star certification. This activity aligns with our community partners and the Success by 6 Strategic Plan for Austin/Travis County to increase the supply of quality child care programs in Travis County. As previously mentioned, Category 1 scores over the past few years have seen a steady decline (2022- average  2.38, 2023 - average  2.33, 2024- average  1.98). Supporting National Accreditation would support the effort to increase Category 1 scores, as Nationally Accredited programs receive a score of a 3 for Categories 1 and 3. \nTarget Audience: We estimate 20  15 early learning programs will receive a scholarship. We will begin offering scholarships in Quarter 1 and continue through FY2025. \nMeasurable Outcome: Utilizing the monthly National Accreditation report, we will track those programs receiving a scholarship and look to measure the number of programs who maintained their National Accreditation throughout FY2025. \n\nUpdate Q3: Funding for this activity decreased from $24,450 to $16,500 due to fewer applications for reimbursement than anticipated. Funding from this activity was reallocated to the Jeannette Watson Wage Supplement project.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 16500\nOther Activities (Shared Services, Pre-K Partnership Supports, Other Supports)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nJeanette Watson Wage Supplement | CQF 4%\n\nOTHER | 1092800 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Jeannette Watson Wage Supplements - In multiple responses within the Director Needs Survey, programs identified the need for continued support for the Child Care Workforce. This was the number one overall requested activity as well as the top priority that directors wanted to see for the coming year. Therefore, Workforce Solutions Capital Area will continue to invest in our Jeanette Watson Wage Supplement Program. The program aims to augment low wages as well as decrease turnover, helping children maintain a stable relationship with a caregiver. \n$150,000 387,800 of our CQF 4% funding will go toward this activity along with $1,065,000 $705,000 in community partner funding. \nTarget Audience: We anticipate providing Wage Supplements to 250 early learning program staff. While the application process will begin in Quarter 2, we anticipate expenses paid in Quarter 3. \nMeasurable Outcome: Our goal is to have 85%, above the industry average, of staff receiving the Jeanette Watson Wage Supplement remain at their program based on a follow up survey given to recipients after the award has been given.  \n\nUpdate Q3: Funding for this activity decreased from $1,215,000 to $1,092,800 due to loss of outside funding from community partners. The amount of funding through CQF increased from $150,000 to $387,800 to help ensure there was funding to cover this project, however the overall total amount of this project decreased due to outside funding being reduced.\nStaff Retention Incentive | CQF 4% | 1145000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Staff Retention Incentive - The Staff Retention Incentive is designed to reward eligible child care programs by providing funds that can be distributed as bonuses to their dedicated staff. This initiative acknowledges the critical role that staff play in delivering high-quality care and aims to enhance retention and motivation within early learning programs. We will prioritize programs located in Child Care Deserts, caring for children 0-5 years of age, and those serving higher number of CCS children. This activity further supports the data within the Director Needs Survey, where programs identified the need for continued support for the Child Care Workforce. This was the number one overall requested activity as well as the top priority that directors wanted to see for the coming year. Our data gathered in FY2024 supports the need for this project. Based on the staffing data submitted by contract programs of current staff working at early learning programs, we saw Full-Time teacher turn-over rates on average of 22.90%. This is slightly above the state average turnover rate of 20% (https://texestest.org/texas-early-education-turnover-rate/). The goal of this project is to assist programs with lowering the amount of Teacher Turnover the program experiences. \nTarget Audience: an estimated 75 programs, supporting approximately 750 staff, will receive this incentive. \nMeasurable Outcome: Our goal is to have 85%, above the industry average, of staff receiving this Staff Retention Incentive to remain at their program based on a follow up survey we will complete 6 months after the incentive was received.  \n\nUpdate Q2: Start quarter was changed from Q2 to Q3.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 2237800\nTOTAL | 4011117\nEnd of Worksheet\n=== Sheet: Central Texas ===\nWorkforce Solutions of Central Texas\nFFY 2025 Annual Expenditure Plan\nNarrative description of Board's overall plan and strategies for Child Care Quality activities:\nOverall narrative must address:\n• How needs were assessed/determined\n• How success will be measured\n• Alignment with LWDB Strategic Plan | The Workforce Solutions of Central Texas Quality Expenditure Plan aligns with the Board's mission which is to provide quality education, training, and labor market services that give employers and job seekers of the region a competitive advantage in the global economy. Customer-focus, accountability, quality, teamwork, and integrity serve as our foundation and guide our work. This mission focuses on the 7 counties in our board area and the need for child care so that families will have access to adequate, high-quality child care so that families may attend school, work, and increase their quality of life. In order to support early learning programs, which are an essential component in this focus, is to provide resources and opportunities to meet the specific needs and goals of each early learning program in the Workforce Solutions of Central Texas Board area to achieve Texas Rising Star certification, reach a higher star level, or receive or maintain national accreditation. These early learning programs are mentored by Texas Rising Star staff who are highly qualified and trained to provide targeted technical assistance, recommendations for training, materials, and resources. These needs are documented and evaluated often through individualized Continuous Quality Improvement Plans (CQIPs). The Child Care Quality Coordinator together with the lead mentor reviews CQIPs and additional reports that are available through the Children's Learning Institute's Engage platform to gather additional information related to ongoing progress with early learning programs. These results and information from this data serve as the basis for the types of professional development that is planned, and the amount and type of curriculum, equipment, and materials that are needed for the year.   \n\nOur Child Care Quality Advisory Committee meets quarterly and reviews the strategic plan to discuss any updates or additions that might need to be considered. Committee members receive information periodically from other program administrators about the training topics and competencies that are needed for themselves and their teaching staff and reports back to the Quality Coordinator. This important feedback provided from the Advisory Committee, the data from Texas Rising Star reports and observations, mentor feedback, participant evaluations from training sessions, satisfaction surveys from administrators, teachers, and families, and Texas Rising Star assessment results serve as the basis for the development of the annual strategic plan. These same methods of data collection along with other available resources will serve to measure the success of our Strategic Plan for 2025. These data sources include the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services; Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System; local community needs assessments; local early childhood professional organization partners (Central Texas Association for the Education of Young Children, Texas Association for the Education of Young Children, Central Texas Family Child Care Network), Temple College and Central Texas College Child Development Departments, local Child Care Regulations staff, Child Care Services Workforce Specialists, and notes from bi-monthly Program Administrator meetings.  Tools such as mentors direct observation documentation; Facility Assessment Record Form worksheets; Child Care Quality Improvement Plans; Child Care Advisory Committee suggestions; provider requests; Texas Rising Star assessment results, the Child Care Availability Portal, Texas Workforce Commission employment trends, and Child Care Services waiting lists will be used to gather data.\n\nWorkforce Solutions of Central Texas will again focus on increasing the total number of certified Texas Rising Star programs that have a signed agreement with Child Care Services to provide scholarships for eligible families. As a result of efforts to get many early learning programs Texas Rising Star certified over the last 24 months, there is a significant increase in the number of those entry level programs being certified in our area. Our efforts include assisting these programs in achieving a higher star level. There is still a significant need for infant and toddler care in our area. We will continue to support programs seeking to expand their services for this age group, with the goal of increasing the overall capacity of infant and toddler care by 15%, thus helping to bridge the gap in the number of slots available for those families needing care. Additionally, we will offer professional development opportunities tailored to meet the specific needs for both teaching and administrative staff. This includes college scholarships; reimbursements for CDA (Child Development Associates) certification; professional learning communities and cohorts; conferences and other collaborative activities designed to improve staff competence, skills and abilities. We will continue to support programs that are nationally accredited (to include Council on Accreditation for school age programs; National Association for the Education of Young Children for center-based early learning programs and National Association for Family Child Care) accreditation and to provide support for those programs who are maintaining and seeking reaccreditation. Our shared services project includes the opportunity for any Three- and Four-Star early learning programs to participate in activities that will support staff retention, business management, operational effectiveness, including preservice training, and CPR/First Aid training. As part of our efforts to enhance health and safety requirements for our early learning programs, we will offer all Texas Rising Star programs the opportunity to request and receive LifeVac devices (for rescuing a choking child). Additionally, we will offer training to administrators targeted at emergency planning and preparedness, medication administration, and to purchase emergency preparedness kits for their programs. In an effort to reduce the number of incidents of children being dismissed from child care programs and children not receiving the developmental services they require, we will continue to support and provide training for any early learning programs utilizing the ASQ and ASQ-SE (Ages & Stages and Ages & Stages Social Emotional) child evaluation system. Our family child care programs will be supported through a project that will reinforce high-quality administrative practices that are crucial for ensuring program quality and providing beneficial results for children and families.\nWho administers the CCQ funds? | Board\nIf the Board selects \"Both\" from above, describe in detail how this is coordinated.\nInfant & Toddler (including Professional Development)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nInfant & Toddler Specific Training | CCQ 2%\n\nCQF 4% | 10000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: We will provide targeted professional development for teachers of infants and toddlers who work in Texas Rising Star-certified programs and those programs working towards certification. The basis for this needed activity is the limited number of available slots for infants and toddlers (based on feedback from Child Care Services Specialists and program administrators.) Child Care Regulation staff have also reported the frequently cited deficiencies in areas specifically related to infant and toddler care. This activity supports the Board strategic plan of increasing the quality of child care in our area. \nTargeted Outreach: This activity will be provided to all early learning programs who provide infant and toddler care. (approximately 230 early learning programs and 250 staff will be served). \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure success by reviewing training evaluations, by tracking Child Care Regulation deficiencies related to infant and toddler care and use the Infant Toddler Specialist Alignment to Texas Rising Star Standards document as a resource for supporting documentation for professional development and training. Our goal is to decrease the number of Child Care Regulation deficiencies related to infant and toddler care by 10%. Another goal is to ultimately increase the number and availability of slots for infant and toddler care in our area by 10%. \nWe anticipate about 90% of this funding to be from CCQ and 10% from CQF.\nFamily Engagement Training | CCQ 2% | 5000 | Quarter 2 | Activity: Based on recommendations from mentors, and administrators, our Infant Toddler Specialist will conduct a training session from the Family Engagement series (through Infant Toddler Specialist Network and Children's Learning Institute). We will invite programs to send their infant and toddler teachers who would like to participate and for these teachers to bring at least one child's family member with them to attend the training.  Through consultation with our Infant Toddler Specialist and the Infant Toddler Specialist Network team at Children's Learning Institute we were encouraged to support such an effort in order to meet the growing needs of families with young children who struggle with understanding typical and atypical behavior with children under 3 years. The Board strategic plan supports the quality of life for area families. \nTargeted Outreach: We hope to be able to serve at least 30 early learning program staff.\nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure the success of this activity through evaluations following the training, mentor observations and reports, and family surveys. We aim to increase scores in Category 2 (Teacher/Child Interactions) and Category 3 (Family Engagement) on Texas Rising Star assessments. We plan to use the Family Engagement Strategies: Infant and Toddler Teacher Checklist from Children's Learning Institute, our Infant Toddler Specialist will solicit feedback from the other Texas Rising Star mentors on specific details for the additional training content that will target the issues and concerns from their own personal observations and provider requests for future training sessions offered to both teachers and families.\nMaterials & Equipment to include Curriculum | CCQ 2%\n\nCQF 4% | 50000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: According to data received from the results of CQIPs, Texas Rising Star assessment results, and the Child Care Availability Portal, there is a need for us to purchase curriculum, materials, and equipment for early learning programs who are seeking Texas Rising Star certification to increase their star level. We will also purchase these resources for those who are Texas Rising Star-certified that wish to increase capacity and open additional slots for infant and toddler care.\nTargeted Outreach: Approximately 75 early learning programs \nMeasurable Outcome: We will measure the success of this activity by evaluating Continuous Quality Improvement goals met, reviewing data from the Child Care Availability Portal, and monitoring our CCS waiting list. We aim to increase scores in Category 3 (teacher training) and Category 4 (indoor and outdoor environments). Data from Texas Rising Star assessment results will also be used to measure success. \nFunding will be about 75% from CQF and 25% from CCQ.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 65000\nProfessional Development\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nSubstitute/Release Time Support | CCQ 4% | 0 | Quarter 3 | Activity: With the ultimate goal of creating more child care slots in Texas Rising Star programs for families in our area, we hope to support Three- and Four-Star center-based programs partnering with local school districts in their district area. Early learning programs will be able to employ high-school students enrolled in CTE (Career and Technical Education) programs who can then serve as substitute teachers, allowing teachers to attend training and professional development during the workday. By providing substitutes, teachers can attend high quality training that will in turn increase their knowledge, skills, and abilities. Additionally through this partnership with the high school career preparation programs in school districts, we are also increasing the availability of the highly qualified teachers in the child care workforce. \nTargeted Outreach: 5 early learning programs to support approx. 10 staff\nMeasurable Outcome: We will use data from the Child Care Availability Portal, administrator feedback, and assessment results in category 1 and the staff worksheet from the Facility Assessment Record Form to measure the outcomes of this activity. \nWe do not anticipate any expenditures for this activity.\nUpdate Q2: Change from Q2 to Q3 due to delay in execution.\nCDA Completion Incentive | CQF 4% | 10000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: We will offer monetary bonuses for teachers who complete a Spanish Child Development Associate (CDA) course through the Workforce Solutions of Central Texas contractor and receive the CDA Credential, complete a CDA course at the college level and receive their Child Development Associates certificate, or complete a CDA or associate’s degree at the college level. This activity supports the Board's strategic plan to increase the quality of life for residents and offer high-quality training. By offering this opportunity our aim is to increase the level of knowledge, skills, and abilities in early childhood education. Monetary bonuses of up to $1,000 will be available for all eligible teachers and administrators in Texas Rising Star certified Three- and Four-Star programs (approximately 100 programs). The basis for this activity is from feedback Administrators provided during Program Administrator meetings as well as communication with mentors during scheduled visits. The Child Care Advisory Committee recognized the need for continuing education specifically for our large Spanish speaking population and explored ways to incentivize teachers who completed these credentials during its scheduled meetings and based on the feedback from Administrators and the Committee the focus of the incentives would assist programs in retaining high quality staff and increase Star levels. \nTargeted Outreach: We hope to serve at least 12 participants. \nMeasurable Outcome: The success of this activity will be determined by evaluating the increased star level and scores on Texas Rising Star assessments and recertifications. We hope to increase credential attainment rate and course completion rate for those receiving scholarships by 10%. Data will be collected from Administrator feedback, Department Chairs at the colleges, and Texas Rising Star reports. \nUpdate Q3: Change from Q2 to Q3 due to delay in execution.\nCDA/College Scholarships | CCQ 2% | 10000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: Our Board's mission to support the workforce and increase the quality of life for residents is in alignment with this activity which seeks to increase the level of knowledge in early childhood education to include attainment of CDA and Associate of Arts degrees or other early childhood related certificates. Scholarships will be available for all eligible teachers and administrators in Texas Rising Star-certified programs (approximately 200 programs). From data received through Temple College and Central Texas college, there is clear evidence that helping to increase enrollment in early childhood courses not only supports our early childhood workforce, but helps to sustain the child development programs at both of these colleges.  \nTargeted Outreach: Approximately 10 child care staff will be served. \nMeasurable Outcome: Success of this activity will be determined by evaluating the increase in scores on Texas Rising Star assessments and recertifications and the enrollment increases per semester for course completion and credential attainment in early childhood education related fields at local community colleges (Child Development Associates; Associate of Arts degrees; Child Development certificates).\nLeadership Academy Completion Bonus | CCQ 4% | 6300 | Quarter 4 | Activity: Because of the participation in the Together 4 Children's Leadership Academy, our Board area had 18 program administrators participate and complete the certification. We recognize the work and effort put forth to receive this certification and want to reward them for this by awarding each with a one-time bonus of $350. This activity aligns with our mission to improve the competence, skills, and abilities of early learning program administrators, thus increasing the quality of child care availability. \nTargeted Outreach: 18 program administrators\nMeasurable Outcome: The outcome will be measured by an increase in Texas Rising Star assessment results and retention of administrators in their current positions. We will use data from a follow-up survey among recipients and annual monitoring and reassessment scores from Texas Rising Star.\nUpdate Q2: Leadership Academy Completion Bonus activity added.\nProfessional Development Opportunities | CCQ 2%\n\nCCF 4% | 50000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: The basis for offering this activity is mentor and administrator feedback, CQIP goals, Child Care Regulation recommendations, and Child Care Advisory Committee recommendations. Opportunities will be provided through group sessions; learning communities and cohorts; co-sponsoring conferences; and providing scholarships for attendance at other agency conferences on a variety of topics and through a variety of formats targeted for the specific audiences (administrators, teachers, training in Spanish). Training for utilizing the McCormick Institute for Early Childhood Leadership's Program Administration Scale will be provided for family child care programs. Specific/targeted training will be provided for any early learning programs utilizing the ASQ and ASQ-SE (Ages & Stages and Ages & Stages Social Emotional) child evaluation system. All these activities align with the Board's strategy and mission to improve staff competence, skills and abilities and provide high-quality child care. \nTargeted Outreach: Approximately 200 staff will be served. These training opportunities will be provided to all 200 programs (according to their Texas Rising Star status). \nMeasurable Outcome: The measurable outcomes will be at least 10% higher scores in Categories 2 and 4 as well as Category 1 (teacher annual training requirements). We will use data from Texas Rising Star Assessments results, Child Care Regulation compliance history, and evaluations submitted following professional development activities.\nWe anticipate expenditures to be 40% CCQ and 60% CQF.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 76300\nTexas Rising Star/Quality Improvement (except Professional Development; include Texas Rising Star personnel)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nTexas Rising Star Staff Personnel Costs | CCQ 2% | 758394 | Quarter 1 | Activity: By providing 7 mentors (salaries, benefits, and other personnel costs) we will provide mentoring assistance to Texas Rising Star Entry Level and certified early learning programs.\nTargeted Outreach: Approximately 260 programs will be served. \nMeasurable Outcome: Success will be measured by evaluating the number of Texas Rising Star entry level programs receiving certification and the number of Texas Rising Star-certified programs maintaining or increasing star level. The total number of Texas Rising Star-certified programs will increase by 5%.\nPerforming parent education and outreach | CCQ 2% | 5000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Our Board plans to partner with the Harker Heights Library and the Central Texas Chapter of Association for the  Education of Young Children to sponsor a family event during Week of the Young Child to bring awareness of quality child care and relevant family resources to the local community. Supporting the employees and families in Central Texas to provide high quality child care and early learning is a goal of our strategic plan and this event will provide the opportunity to do that.  Our basis for implementing this activity into our plan was based on recommendations from the Education Coordinator at the Harker Heights Library, our Advisory Committee, and mentors who work directly with administrators who requested this as well.\nTargeted Outreach: Approximately 300 families will be reached. \nMeasurable Outcome: Success will be measured by the reduction in child care moves from program to program based on feedback from Child Care Specialists and the Child Care Advisory Committee recommendations. We aim for A 5% decrease in the number of deficiencies with Child Care Regulations, and an increase the number of successful placements in Texas Rising Star-certified programs by 10%. Family satisfaction survey results will also be used for data collection. \nFunding: We anticipate 100% of the funding from this activity to come from CCQ.\nUpdate Q2: Change from Q1 to Q2 due to delay in execution.\nQuality Initiative Reimbursement | CCQ 2% | 55000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: In order to support the Board's mission to increase the availability of quality child care for our community and to support with wages for child care staff, we plan to offer reimbursements to our local match partners who operate employee child care centers, lab schools, and BAEYC accredited programs. As a way to support these programs in providing quality child care to school district employees and activity duty military families, the Board will reimburse them to support wage supplements and materials and equipment.\nTarget Outreach: 7 local match partners/early learning programs\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure the effectiveness by examining the data on staff retention, Texas Rising Star assessments, and NAEYC accreditation and reaccreditation results.\nUpdate Q3: Quality Initiative Reimbursement activity added.\nMaterials & Equipment | CCQ 2%\n\nCQF 4% | 400000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: This activity aligns with the Board's strategic plan for increasing the of quality child care. For this activity we will be assisting programs by providing materials and equipment to support them in achieving Texas Rising Star certification, recertification, and supporting existing Two- and Three-Star programs in achieving a higher star level. According to data, scores in Category 4 (indoor and outdoor (environments) from Texas Rising Star Assessment results, Continuous Quality Improvement Plans, mentor feedback from observations, and teacher and administrator requests, programs often lack the materials and equipment they can afford and need to meet points-based measures and reach higher Star levels. \nTarget Outreach: Approximately 260 programs will be served. \nMeasurable Outcome: Success will be measured by the attainment of identified goals on the Continuous Quality Improvement Plan and Texas Rising Star increased  and higher assessment scores in categories 2 and 4. \nFunding will be divided about 50% each from CCQ ($200,000) and CQF ($200,000) funds.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 1218394\nSupporting Health & Safety Standards (except Professional Development)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nHealth and Safety Materials | CCQ 2% | 50000 | Quarter 2 | Activity: We aim to provide a safe and healthy environment for children, families, and the workforce in accordance with the Board strategic plan. Based on requests directly from administrators, the Advisory Committee, and Child Care Regulation recommendations, we will purchase life-vac devices to support a healthy and safe environment. \nTargeted Outreach: 95 Texas Rising Star programs\nMeasurable Outcome: Success will be measured by reviewing scores on Texas Rising Star assessments in Category 3, the number of health and safety incidents reported and/or self-reported to Child Care Regulation, and receiving director feedback.\nSupport emergency preparedness | CCQ 2% | 50000 | Quarter 2 | Activity: We aim to provide a safe and healthy environment for children, families, and the workforce in accordance with the Board strategic plan. The Board will purchase emergency preparedness materials for early learning administrators, targeted at emergency planning & preparedness, and medication administration. This activity is based on requests directly from administrators, the Advisory Committee, and Child Care Regulation recommendations. \nTargeted Outreach: 95 Texas Rising Star programs\nMeasurable Outcome: Success will be measured by reviewing training evaluations, reviewing scores on Texas Rising Star assessments in Category 3, reviewing the number of health and safety incidents reported and/or self-reported to Child Care Regulation, and receiving director feedback.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 100000\nEvaluation & Assessment (tools to measure effective practice or child development/progress)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nAges & Stages and Ages & Stages Social Emotional child evaluation tool | CCQ 2% | 1000 | Quarter 2 | Activity: Based on the Board's strategic plan to increase the availability of quality child care and to improve the quality of life for families, we will purchase the ASQ and ASQ-SE (Ages & Stages and Ages & Stages Social Emotional) child evaluation tool for any Texas Rising Star-certified program who requests it. By providing early learning programs with an approved, research-based child assessment that will identify developmental delays and behavior markers, this can be the basis for helping to formally identify children's special needs. Based on recommendations from feedback from mentors’ observations and director & teacher requests, there is a desperate need for training and resources for teachers and families with children who have diverse learning needs. \nTargeted Outreach: We hope to serve at least 12 programs who want to participate. \nMeasurable Outcome: We hope to reduce the rate of children's expulsion by 10% by providing this tool to increase knowledge and find resources. Success will be measured by looking for an increase in the number of children who receive professional assistance with developmental, behavioral, or other special needs in Texas Rising Star certified programs and reviewing the number of Texas Rising Star Certified programs receiving an enhanced rate for providing care for children with identified special needs and seek to have at least 25 programs in our area utilizing this opportunity. This data will be provided from Child Care Specialists who enroll children into the scholarship program.\nProgram Administration Scale tool (Home-based programs) | CCQ 2% | 0 | Quarter 2 | Activity: We plan to purchase the Program Administration Scale for eligible accredited family child care programs. By investing in the ongoing knowledge, and skills of the specific programs, we will be aligned with the Board's strategic plan to support families' access to quality child care. The support provided to family child care programs will assist in them in implementing high-quality administrative practices. Programs that receive this tool will then share their knowledge through their participation in our local family child care network (eventually impacting up to 25 family child care programs). \nTargeted Outreach: We hope to support at least 2 of the NAFCC accredited Three- and Four-Star Texas Rising Star certified programs \nMeasurable Outcome: Success will be measured by an increase in the number of family child care programs who are at least Three- and Four-Star Texas Rising Star certified by 5%. We will measure this by the reviewing the number of Texas Rising Star-certified family child care programs who are at a Three- and Four-Star level and by evaluating the data from the child care waiting list. Family and program surveys will also be used. \nUpdate Q2: We were not able to attend the McCormick Leadership Institute to receive the training, as the Board's proposal to present at the Institute wasn't accepted. Both of the family child care programs that were identified to attend ended up with conflicts that wouldn't allow them to attend. We hope to be able to look at maybe an online option for this next year. The $40,000 in funding was moved to the Quality Initiative Reimbursement activity.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 1000\nSupporting National Accreditation\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nSupport National Accreditation | CCQ 2%\n\nCQF 4% | 118000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: For more than a decade, our Board has partnered with U.S. Army - Fort Cavazos Children and Youth Services Department. A research study in 2010 about the quality of life for both active duty and retired service families stationed there, provided data regarding the child care needs of these military families in our area. The findings concluded that there was a significant deficit in the number of child care programs who were accredited with the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), and eligible to provide adequate child care. The Board made a commitment following the release of this data that we will support programs in the voluntary pursuit of National Accreditation (to now include Council on Accreditation for school age programs; NAEYC for center-based early learning programs and National Association for Family Child Care). To be eligible (at least Three- and Four-Star certified for at least 12 months) early learning program who signs a Memorandum of Understanding to participate in the Quality Improvement Project for Accreditation Support will receive targeted support based on their accreditation station, valued at up to $6,000 that includes application or renewal fees; technical assistance and consultation services for portfolio development, observations, and program reviews, and materials and equipment purchases.  \nTargeted Outreach: approximately 20 total (new and renewing programs)\nMeasurable Outcome: We will continue to measure success by evaluating the total number Accredited programs in our area. Family and program satisfaction surveys will also be used for data collection in reviewing these activities.\nFunding for these activities will be divided about 50% from CCQ ($59,000) and about 50% from CQF funds ($59,000).\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 118000\nOther Activities (Shared Services, Pre-K Partnership Supports, Other Supports)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nSupport the Shared Services Alliance | CCQ 2% | 20000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: To support the Board's strategic plan and based on recommendations from the Child Development Department at Temple College, the Child Care Advisory Committee, the feedback received during Program Administrator meetings, and data from the Texas Association for the Education of Young Children (TXAEYC), we will continue to support early learning programs who participate in the Central Texas Shared Services Alliance. Activities that will support staff retention, business management, operational effectiveness, including preservice training, and CPR/First Aid training, and membership in the TXAEYC's Shared Services program will be offered to Three- and Four-Star certified Texas Rising Star programs who sign a Memorandum of Understanding and participate in the local alliance project. We plan to reimburse participating programs 50% of the cost of an annual membership in the TXAEYC Shared Services project; provide CPR and 1st aid training free of charge that is offered through the Workforce Solutions of Central Texas approved vendors; and pay for each staff person employed at a participating program to receive required pre-service training through Temple College's Continuing Education Child Development Department. Other support including Food Service and Supply are offered to programs at no cost to our Board.\nTargeted Outreach: We anticipate at least 20 early learning programs participating in the project. \nMeasurable Outcome: Success will be measured by a decrease in the number of Child Care Regulation deficiencies and an increase in the Texas Rising Stars scores in categories 1 and 3. We will look for at least a 10% increase in the number of participating programs from last year, at least a 5% decrease in the number of Child Care Regulation deficiencies related to administrative duties and preservice training, and at least a 5% increase in the scores for Texas Rising Star categories 1 and 3 in these participating programs. Data from Child Care Regulation and Texas Rising Star assessment results will provide this information. d.\nRetention Bonuses | CQF 4% | 300000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: Based on the data from TWC employment trends, the Child Care Availability Portal, the Child Care Services waiting list, the Child Care Advisory Committee, and direct feedback from providers, we will offer retention bonuses to each qualified full-time and part-time employee who works in a Texas Rising Star-certified, center-based program. In supporting the mission of our Board, we are meeting a goal for increasing the quality of life for families and giving employers of the region a competitive advantage in the global economy. We will offer this opportunity twice - once in October and again in March 2025. Employers must provide evidence/documents on the required checklist for accounting and proof of at least 2 years of continuous employment for the $500 award; 5 - 9 years of a staff person's employment = $1,000; and 10 years + receives $1,500. This award will be paid directly to the employee. All staff regardless of their position are eligible. Anyone who has a vested interest in the ownership of the child care center is not eligible for the incentive. All certified Texas Rising Star certified center-based programs who sign a Memorandum of Understanding are eligible to participate in the Employee Incentive Project. The exception is for centers who are school district or college sponsored.\nTargeted Outreach:  We anticipate up to 100 employees could be eligible for this initiative. \nMeasurable Outcome: Measurable data will include results from program surveys from the employee and employer as well as an increase in Texas Rising Star categories 1and 3. The goal is for participating programs to retain 80% of full and part-time staff for at least 12 months. \nUpdate Q3: Change from Q1 to Q3.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 320000\nTOTAL | 1898694\nEnd of Worksheet\n=== Sheet: Coastal Bend ===\nWorkforce Solutions of the Coastal Bend\nFFY 2025 Annual Expenditure Plan\nNarrative description of Board's overall plan and strategies for Child Care Quality activities:\nOverall narrative must address:\n• How needs were assessed/determined\n• How success will be measured\n• Alignment with LWDB Strategic Plan | Workforce Solutions of the Coastal Bend's (WFSCB's) child care quality activities during BCY2025 will consist of onboarding the newest WFSCB Entry Level-designated child care programs to assist them in obtaining Texas Rising Star certification within their two-year Entry Level timeframe. The Texas Rising Star mentor staff will provide mentoring services to the Entry Level-designated child care programs throughout the BCY2025 contract year. The Entry Level-designated child care programs will receive age-appropriate Frogstreet curriculum kits and Lakeshore instructional resources that will assist them in achieving \"higher\" ratings in certain Texas Rising Star categories during the initial Texas Rising Star assessment. WFSCB will provide professional development training workshops throughout the contract year for its child care directors and staffs.  The professional development training workshops will focus on early literacy and early literacy (Frogstreet curriculum training workshops); directors management topics; and children with special needs. WFSCB will implement a Mental Wellness Initiative in BCY2025.  The purpose of this initiative is to improve staff retention at our child care facilities by providing child care staff with onsite support that will help them identify/appropriately address children with challenging behaviors. Staff will learn about developmentally appropriate behaviors (DAP) and how to manage these behaviors and determine when a referral to ECI/Child Find is needed to address those behaviors that are not developmental in nature. \n\nWFSCB surveys our child care programs quarterly to determine what their needs are regarding professional development trainings and resources. The child care quality activities and strategies outlined in the child care quality expenditure plan align with our Board's Strategic Plan by enhancing/elevating the level of quality and service provided by the child care staff at these child care centers.  This allows the child care staff at these child care centers to provide an enhanced level of quality in the services they provide to the children and families they serve.  An indirect benefit of the child care quality activities we provide is that it \"helps to shape and build the workforce of the future by establishing an instructional/educational  foundation for children ages 0-5\".  This foundation will hopefully prevent these children from developing any educational gaps in learning when they enter the public school system.  \n\nWFSCB will measure the success of these specific initiatives based on the following indicators:  (1) Success of the utilization of the Frogstreet curriculum and assessments in the Pre-Kindergarten classrooms will be based on student performance on the Frogstreet assessment tools for these instructional concepts with a minimum of 70% of the children in these classrooms demonstrating mastery. (2) The success of directors management training; children with special needs professional development training workshops; and the Child Care Quality Program events, i.e. the Directors Symposium, the \"Back to School\" Teachers Fair, and the Home Providers Symposium will be based on attendance and measured by the number of child care staff who attend the professional development training workshops, classes, and events (indicated in other categories listed on the Expenditure Plan).  Staff attendance at the professional development training workshops and child care quality program events will assist the child care workers in meeting Child Care Regulations Minimum Standards annual professional development training hours requirement. (3) The success of the items purchased for the Entry Level-designated programs will be determined by the program attaining a \"minimum score\" of Three-Star during the program's Texas Rising Star initial assessment.\nWho administers the CCQ funds? | Board\nIf the Board selects \"Both\" from above, describe in detail how this is coordinated.\nInfant & Toddler (including Professional Development)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nInfant/Toddler Expansion Project (Resources & Equipment) | CCQ 2% | 10688.98 | Quarter 3 | Activity: The Infant/Toddler Expansion Project addresses the shortage of infant/toddler slots currently available in the Board's 11-county region. This activity aligns with the Board's strategy to increase \"capacity\" to serve infant and toddler aged children in its 11-county region. Programs must have an empty classroom/space that can be designated as an infant or toddler classroom.  WFSCB will provide the materials, equipment, and resources specific to infant and toddler development, including but not limited to, cribs, changing tables, chairs, high chairs, and curriculum. The program will hire and pay the salary of the classroom teacher. \nTarget Audience: WFSCB estimates that 8 to 10 child care centers will participate in the Infant/Toddler Expansion Project in BCY2025. \nMeasurable Outcome: The expected outcomes are to increase the number of infant/toddler slots, i.e. capacity in our Board area by the following numbers: (a) 40 infants, (b) 80 toddlers, or (c) a combination of 20 infants and 40 toddlers for a total of 60 additional slots in our region. The success of the Infant/Toddler Expansion Project will be based on two criteria, (1) the number of infant/toddler slots created during BCY2025 (as mentioned previously) and the number of infant/toddler teachers at child care centers who participate in the Infant/Toddler Expansion Project and who are receiving mentoring services will achieve a \"minimum\" score of 2 or higher in Category 2 (Teacher-Child Interactions) or Category 4 (Indoor/Outdoor Learning Environments).  \nUpdate Q2: This activity was delayed and is scheduled to begin during the third quarter of BCY2025.\nUpdate Q3: During the third quarter of BCY2025, funding was decreased from $174,888 to $106,888.98. The remaining $68,000.00 was redistributed to the staff retention bonuses line item in order to support more staff.\nMental Wellness Initiative | CCQ 2% | 0 | Quarter 3 | Activity: WFSCB would like to create a Mental Health/Mental Wellness Initiative for children who attend Workforce Child Care centers in BCY2025. The purpose of this initiative is to improve staff retention at our child care facilities by providing child care staff with onsite support (on a quarterly basis) that will help them identify and appropriately address children with challenging behaviors. Staff will learn about developmentally appropriate behaviors and how to manage these behaviors and determine when a referral to ECI/Child Find is needed to address those behaviors that are not developmental in nature. We will partner with a mental health/mental wellness professional in our community to identify program participants, timelines for the Mental Health/Mental Wellness program, program objectives, and outcomes. \nTarget Audience: This program will be piloted at 12 child care centers serving infants and toddlers in the Coastal Bend region during BCY2025. \nMeasurable Outcome: The success of the Mental Health/Mental Wellness initiative will be based on having 6 of the 12 targeted child care centers experience \"0%\" or less than \"20%\" staff turnover from January 2025 to August 2025 of BCY2025.   \nUpdate Q2: This activity is delayed and will possibly begin during the third quarter of BCY2025.\nUpdate Q3: During the third quarter of BCY2025, the planned estimated expenditures of $39,000.00 for the Mental Wellness Initiative was redistributed to the staff retention bonuses line item.  The justification for reallocating this funding is attributed to the lack of interest in the initiative and desire to support more staff with the retention bonus.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 10688.98\nProfessional Development\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nProfessional Development Training Workshops | CCQ 2% | 4500 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Professional development training workshops align with the Board's child care quality program initiatives for school readiness (early literacy and early numeracy), children with special needs, and directors management topics. Professional development training workshops will be conducted on Pre-Service Training; Frogstreet curriculum; Child Care Regulation's Minimum Standards update(s); Challenging Behaviors and Classroom Management; Health and Safety Topics; Staff Retention; and Staff Wellness. A minimum of at least 2 professional development training workshops will be offered each quarter (beginning the second quarter) of BCY2025. Child care staff who attend the professional development training workshops will receive a certificate for 6 clock hours of training which staff may use to meet the Child Care Regulation's annual training hours requirement. Staff will learn information and strategies that will increase their knowledge of early childhood education and enhance their interactions with the children they serve on a daily basis which will reduce the number of Child Care Regulation licensing deficiencies the child care center could possibly receive. \nTarget Audience: Professional development training workshops are available to all child care programs with Workforce Provider Agreements. The goal of each professional development training workshop is to have (a minimum of) 20 child care staff attend each training workshop (2 professional development training workshops per quarter beginning in the third quarter  = a minimum of 80 child care staff).  \nMeasurable Outcome: The measurable outcome for each professional development training workshop(s) will ideally be, 20 child care staff will attend each professional development training workshop.  \nUpdate Q3: Funding was decreased from $107,861 to $4,500. $103,361 was redistributed to the staff retention bonuses line item.  The justification for reallocating this funding is attributed to the Board not offering as many professional development opportunities and to increase the supports to staff with retention bonuses.\nChild Development Associate Scholarship | CCQ 2%\nCQF 4% | 0 | Quarter 2 | Activity: WFSCB would like to provide Child Development Associate credential training for child care employees.  We would collaborate with the community college to provide this training. WFSCB will pay for the tuition, textbooks, Child Development Associate test, and the Child Development Associate credential for each child care employee who participates in the Child Development Associate credential training.  \nTarget Audience: The goal is to have 30 child care center employees complete this training and receive their Child Development Associate credential by September 30, 2025.\nMeasurable Outcome: The measurable outcome for the Child Development Associate credential training for child care employees is to conduct two 10-week long (120 clock hours) training sessions with a minimum of 10 child care staff participating in each training session.  \nUpdate Q2: This activity has been delayed.\nUpdate Q3: During the third quarter of BCY2025, the planned estimated expenditures of $75,000.00 for this initiative was redistributed to Resources and Equipment under the Texas Rising Star/Quality Improvement category to ensure there was sufficient funding to purchase curriculum and instructional resources for child care programs in BCY2025. The justification for reallocating this funding is attributed to the lack of interest by child care program staff.\nChild Care Conferences and Events (Directors Symposium, \"Back to School\" Teachers Fair, Home Providers Symposium) | CCQ 2% | 91000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: The child care quality events are an extension of the professional development training workshops. They align with the Board's child care quality program initiatives for school readiness (early literacy and early numeracy), children with special needs, and directors management topics. Staff attendance at the child care quality program events will assist the child care workers in meeting Child Care Regulation Minimum Standards annual professional development training hours requirement. These events consist of breakout sessions on early childhood education and directors management topics that are conducted by professional trainers. The attendees at the child care quality events receive a training certificate for six (6) clock hours of training that may be used to meet the Child Care Regulation's Minimum Standards annual training hours requirement. \nTarget Audience: The number varies for each Child Care Conference/Event (depending on the event). Ideally, 75 - 100 child care directors and assistant directors for the Directors Symposium; 300 - 400 child care staff for the \"Back to School\" Teachers Fair; and 60 - 70 providers for the Home Providers Symposium. A total of approx. 570 child care staff will attend the 3 events (which may include duplicated child care staff.)\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for its Child Care Conferences/Events based on child care staff attendance at the child care quality events. The measurable outcomes for the child care quality events will be 75 child care center directors and assistant directors will attend the Directors Symposium; 325 child care staff will attend the \"Back to School\" Teachers Fair; 65 homes will attend the Home Program Symposium.  \nUpdate Q3: Funding was decreased from $150,000 to $91,000. $59,000.00 was redistributed to Staff Retention Bonuses. The justification for reallocating this funding is attributed to not hosting a Home Program Symposium during BCY2025.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 95500\nTexas Rising Star/Quality Improvement (except Professional Development; include Texas Rising Star personnel)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nTexas Rising Star Staff Personnel | CCQ 2% | 636286 | Quarter 1 | Activity: This funding will be used to cover salary/personnel costs for 9 Texas Rising Star staff (mentors), travel expenses, and any training the staff will need in BCY2025. The mentors will attend professional development training conferences and workshops throughout the contract year.  Attendance at these professional development training activities will assist them in meeting the requirement of obtaining a minimum of 36 hours of professional development training annually. WFSCB will conduct quarterly Texas Rising Star Provider Meetings supported by the mentors to share Texas Rising Star updates and information with the child care center directors and assistant directors. The Texas Rising Star mentors will provide mentoring services to the newest Entry Level-designated child care programs who are working toward obtaining Texas Rising Star certification status by the end of their 24 month onboarding timeframe and those who were granted an extension waiver at the end of the BCY2024 contract year, as well as ongoing mentoring services to Texas Rising Star-certified child care programs. \nTarget Audience: The mentors will work with about 130 Entry Level-designated and 62 certified child care programs during BCY2025.\nResources and Equipment | CQF 4% | 199999.61 | Quarter 1 | Activity: This funding will be used to purchase curriculum and instructional resources for child care centers pursuing Texas Rising Star certification in BCY2025. Board staff surveyed the Entry Level-designated child care programs with Workforce Provider Agreements effective October 1, 2023 in September to determine if the directors at these child care centers wanted/would use curriculum and instructional resources to assist in achieving the higher Texas Rising Star levels (Three- or Four-Star). The curriculum and instructional resources will assist these child care centers in obtaining the highest scores possible in the domain categories on the Texas Rising Star initial assessment. The classroom teachers at these child care centers will use the curriculum and instructional resources to provide early literacy and early numeracy in the 4- and 5-year-old classrooms at these child care centers. Child care staff in the preschool classrooms will use these resources to enhance the quality of services they provide to their children on a daily basis.  Additionally, WFSCB will purchase equipment (furniture, books, etc...) and resources to be placed in the different classroom centers  to create \"Model\" classrooms at 2 Texas Rising Star-certified child care centers during the BCY2025 contract year. Staff from other child care centers will be allowed to tour and observe the \"Model\" classrooms to see/learn how to set up their classroom(s).\nTarget Audience: at least 25 Entry Level-designated child care programs\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure the success of this activity based on the scores child care staff receive in the warm responsive caregiving subcategory on the Texas Rising Star initial assessment. The Board's goal is to have 75% of the child care teachers at the Entry Level-designated child care centers score at least a \"2\" in the warm responsive caregiving subcategory on the initial Texas Rising Star assessment.  \nUpdate: Funding was increased by $75,000.00 (original estimate was $199,999.61) that was previously allocated for the Child Development Associate Scholarship under the Professional Development category to ensure that there is sufficient funding to purchase curriculum and resources for child care programs during BCY2025.\nParent Engagement Community Event | CCQ 2% | 0 | Quarter 3 | Activity: Workforce Solutions of the Coastal Bend will host its first parent engagement community event. The funding for this event will allow Workforce Solutions of the Coastal Bend to partner with businesses and organizations that provide services for children and families in the community, i.e. the Health Department, Health and Human Services, Driscoll Children's Hospital, etc... This activity aligns with the purpose of our Board - to provide employee assistance, serve as an education and training resource, and offer child care assistance.  This event will allow Workforce Solutions of the Coastal Bend to promote/educate the Child Care Services families about the other Workforce programs and community resources that benefit children and families. The goal is to have at least 30 Child Care Services Program families attend the Parent Engagement Community Event.  \nTarget Audience: Workforce Child Care Services program parents and children.                                                                                                                                                                                                \nMeasurable Outcome:  The success of this event will be measured by having representatives from a minimum of 10 community resource organizations and 25 families will participate in this event.  Update Q3: During the third quarter of BCY2025, the planned estimated expenditures of $50,000.00 for the Parent Engagement Community Event was previously allocated to this initiative has been redistributed to the Other Activities \"Staff Retention Bonuses\" line item.  The justification for reallocating this funding is attributed to inability to conduct this activity as the Board has not hired the staff dedicated to this initiative.\nTexas Rising Star Personnel - Child Care Quality Program Support Specialist | CCQ 2% | 55000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: WFSCB would like to hire a Child Care Quality Program Support Specialist. This would be a full-time position that would provide assistance with the parent engagement activities and gathering the information necessary to distribute staff retention bonuses to child care employees in our 11 counties. \nTarget Audience: All parents (approximately 3,000) and 175 early learning programs.\nMeasurable Outcome: Success will be measured by the completion rate of quality events and activities, as well as periodic policy reviews that include participant surveys.\nUpdate: Q2 this position has been delayed and remains vacant.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 891285.61\nSupporting Health & Safety Standards (except Professional Development)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nNone\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 0\nEvaluation & Assessment (tools to measure effective practice or child development/progress)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nNone\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 0\nSupporting National Accreditation\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nNational Accreditation (NAEYC Certification) | CQF 4% | 0 | Quarter 2 | WFSCB utilized the  Workforce Information System of Texas to determine how many of its current child care providers have the National Association for the Education of Young Children accreditation.  There are currently 6 WFSCB child care programs who have the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) accreditation. The pursuit of NAEYC accreditation for the Texas Rising Star Four-Star child care programs is/has been a longstanding child care quality program goal that has been repeatedly communicated to the Board's Child Care Committee since 2020. This accreditation status represents the highest level in quality that a child care center can achieve. \nActivity: WFSCB will begin working with our Texas Rising Star Four-Star programs in pursuing/attaining NAEYC accreditation in BCY2025. Texas Rising Star staff will need training on the NAEYC accreditation process. Once staff have been trained on the accreditation process, we will identify the Texas Rising Star Four-Star programs who will participate in this accreditation process during BCY2025. Each Texas Rising Star Four-Star program who attains NAEYC accreditation will receive a $5,000 stipend.   \nTarget Audience: 10 Texas Rising Star Four-Star programs will begin NAEYC accreditation process in BCY2025.  \nMeasurable Outcome: Success for NAEYC accreditation in BCY2025 will be based on having 5 out of the 10 targeted Texas Rising Star child care programs receive technical assistance for and completing the initial phase of the accreditation process.  \nUpdate: Q2: This activity has been delayed and will begin during the third quarter of BCY2025.)\nUpdate Q3: In the third quarter of BCY2025, the $100,000 previously allocated to this initiative has been redistributed to the Other Activities \"Staff Retention Bonuses\" line item.  The justification for reallocating this funding is attributed to the lack of interest by child care programs.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 0\nOther Activities (Shared Services, Pre-K Partnership Supports, Other Supports)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nShared Services - Wonderschool Project | CCQ 2% | 108668.39 | Quarter 2 | Activity: WFSCB will identify eligible child care programs to participate in a pilot project with Wonderschool during BCY2025. Business consultants from Wonderschool will work with the child care directors in the areas of staff retention, financial budgeting, marketing/promotion, and human resources. The objective of the Wonderschool Project is to assist these child care programs in retention of staff and marketing their centers which will hopefully lead to an increase in their child enrollments and retention of staff. Board staff will meet with the Wonderschool staff quarterly to identify goals and timelines to determine how these child care centers are progressing in the pilot program. \nTarget Audience: 8 child care programs \nMeasurable Outcome: Success for the Wonderschool Project will be based on having a minimum of 50% of staff being retained at 4 out of the targeted 8 child care programs in BCY2025. The employees must have been employed for a minimum of 9 months (December 2024 to August 2025).\nStaff Retention Bonuses | CQF 4% | 819361 | Quarter 3 | In October, Board staff sent a survey to 164 Workforce child care programs to determine if there was an interest/need for financial assistance to child care employees employed at their respective facilities. The survey asked for the number of full-time, part-time, and support staff who are/will be employed at the child care center for a minimum of six (6) months. We received responses back from over 100 child care programs who were very receptive to receiving the staff retention bonuses.  \nActivity: WFSCB understands and acknowledges that there is a shortage of child care workers in our 11-county Board area and would like to assist child center directors in retaining their staffs by offering/providing staff retention bonuses for all center staff (full-time, part-time, and support) who are currently working at the child care center and who have been employed for a minimum of 6 consecutive months (as of October 2024) at the child care center. The rationale for providing the staff retention bonuses to the child care center employees is to \"thank them\" for having been employed at their current child care center for at least six months and encourage them to remain at their current places of employment for longer periods of time. \nTarget Audience: Our goal is to award staff retention bonuses to 1,000 child care employees who have been employed as of October 1, 2024 and who have worked for a minimum of six consecutive (6) months. \nMeasurable Outcome: Success for the staff retention bonuses will be measured on having at least 500 employees who received the staff retention bonus in BCY2024 and remain employed at their respective child care center from November 1, 2024 to August 30, 2025. The child care staff who meet this criteria would represent 50% of the targeted 1,000 child care employees that WFSCB would like to award staff retention bonuses to in BCY2025.\nUpdate: Funding was increased from $400,000 CQF to have an additional $419,361 for a total of $819,361 in order to serve more staff. Additional funding was reallocated from the following activities: National Accreditation NAEYC Certification, Infant/Toddler Expansion Project, Mental Wellness Initiative, Professional Development Training Workshops, Child Care Conferences and Events, and Parent Engagement Community Event.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 928029.39\nTOTAL | 1925503.98\nEnd of Worksheet\n=== Sheet: Concho Valley ===\nWorkforce Solutions Concho Valley\nFFY 2025 Annual Expenditure Plan\nNarrative description of Board's overall plan and strategies for Child Care Quality activities:\nOverall narrative must address:\n• How needs were assessed/determined\n• How success will be measured\n• Alignment with LWDB Strategic Plan | Needs have been assessed and determined by data collection through a local early learning program needs survey assessment with data collection concluding January 7, 2025.

Currently there are 218 CCS programs including 130 Texas Rising Star-certified programs. All original Entry Level-designated programs with a required certification date of September 30, 2024, were submitted for assessment prior to submission deadline. Success of onboarding to Texas Rising Star will be measured by the number of Texas Rising Star programs maintaining or increasing their certification level and the number of CCS programs attaining certification. Texas Rising Star conducted surveys to determine directors’ priority in classroom needs, staff education and retention, infant toddler classroom needs and enrollment expansion, playground needs, safety, and health needs. East Texas is continuing FY 2024 plans to incentivize and increase education levels based on the survey. Success of education incentives will be determined by the staff education measure scores on program assessments. East Texas plans on incentivizing staff retention with a longevity stipend. The additional child care slots for eligible children and the goal of filling the child care slots will dictate additional materials and equipment for Texas Rising Star program expansions. East Texas will continue purchasing equipment and materials as dictated by each Texas Rising Star program’s needs assessment.

After completion of a formal curriculum needs assessment and mentor visits that were completed by both Texas Rising Star mentors and the Infant Toddler Specialist, it was determined that our Board area child care programs are in need of current, updated, and age-appropriate curriculum that encompasses all developmental domains. After further review, it has also been determined that the need for curriculum training for child care programs must be provided prior to distributing curriculum items. Therefore, the Board goal is to provide curriculum training along with the curriculum items to child care programs to ensure effective use of the early learning resources. The provided curriculum will include: Infants, Toddlers, Prekindergarten, School Age per documented needs assessment completed in collaboration with the child care program and Texas Rising Star mentor. The curricula provides a holistic approach to early childhood education and includes interactive manipulatives and hands-on learning applications.

NETX employs 4 full-time, highly experienced mentors, each embedded daily within their assigned centers. These recognized experts in child care quality, bring extensive knowledge in early learning, school readiness, and local child care needs. Their role involves providing hands-on guidance while evaluating the strengths, challenges, and specific needs of each center on an individual basis. NETX emphasizes collaboration by encouraging child care programs to share their insights and recommendations. This input ensures that the evolving needs of each center are heard and integrated into the decision-making process. To foster continuous improvement, Board and contractor staff meet monthly to assess the priorities of each Texas Rising Star facility. These meetings ensure that available resources are optimized, operational needs are addressed, and all efforts align with the directives of the TWC and the NETX quality plan. \n\nThe impact of NETX’s quality improvement efforts are measured through both qualitative and quantitative methods. These include program and parent feedback, reductions in licensing deficiencies, and assessments aligned with Texas Rising Star standards. Such evaluations contribute to the improvement, maintenance, or adjustment of each center’s Texas Rising Star certification. \n\nNETX believes that developing a skilled and prepared workforce starts with high-quality early childhood education, facilitated by well-trained, supported, and engaged child care programs. Central to this mission is the comprehensive training of both teachers and directors, equipping them with the tools needed to implement effective educational practices in the classroom. High-quality, well-organized, and engaging child care environments provide parents with peace of mind, knowing their children are thriving in a supportive setting while they rejoin the workforce. NETX delivers approximately 5 training sessions per month for child care program staff, offering creative and practical strategies to enhance curriculum implementation. These sessions target children from birth through after-school students. A key emphasis is placed on Pre-K curriculum to ensure children are prepared for success upon entering public school. All trainings are designed to meet licensing requirements, ensuring programs and directors achieve the necessary training hours for compliance. In addition to training, NETX recognizes that effective classroom management is essential to fostering quality education. To support this, NETX offers the Brightwheel classroom management system to all Texas Rising Star programs. This system, which includes software and tablets, enhances parent-program communication by offering parents real-time access to their child’s activities and interactions with teachers. It also streamlines business operations by facilitating attendance tracking, lesson planning, and classroom activity management. This initiative benefits both Texas Rising Star and non-Texas Rising Star centers, with the potential to impact over 100 classrooms across the region. Further supporting the professional development of educators, NETX offers scholarships for teachers pursuing the Child Development Associate (CDA) credential, along with financial incentives upon completion. NETX also implements the LENA Grow system, which enables mentors to assess teacher-student interactions, providing targeted coaching to enhance classroom quality and improve Texas Rising Star certification. \n\nThrough these initiatives, NETX remains committed to building a robust network of high-quality child care programs. By investing in professional development, innovative classroom management solutions, and collaborative partnerships, NETX ensures that children receive the foundation they need for future success, while empowering programs to deliver exceptional care and education. All activities and expenditures are reviewed with the Child Care Committee which meets on a quarterly basis. Committee members are also solicited for input in determining priorities while executing the plan and increasing quality child care for all child care centers.\nWho administers the CCQ funds? | Board's Child Care Contractor\nIf the Board selects \"Both\" from above, describe in detail how this is coordinated.\nInfant & Toddler (including Professional Development)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nInfant & Toddler Expansion | CQF 4% | 40000 | Quarter 2 | Activity: The Board will provide infant and toddler expansion items for classrooms to support new infant/toddler slots.

Members also thought that Wage Supplement program was a benefit to child care programs, which supported the findings of the FY25 Texas Rising Star Mentor & Support Staff Survey and Directors' Survey. Based on the FY25 Texas Rising Star Mentor and Support Staff Survey, staff reported that one of the top 3 greatest needs for after school programs, home-based programs, and licensed centers was wage supplements with results showing the following: 33.3% of Texas Rising Star mentors and Support Staff reported a need for wage supplements for after-school programs,  33.3% of Texas Rising Star mentors and Support Staff reported a need for wage supplements for  home-based programs, and 55.6% Texas Rising Star mentors & Support Staff reported a need for wage supplements for licensed child care programs would benefit by wage supplement.  In addition, the FY25 Child Care Directors' survey showed that 85.1% believed that Wage Supplements would benefit their programs.   Compensations range from $250-$1000 per single activity, and recipients can qualify for more than one category, leading to additional compensation, up to $5,000.  The overall goal is to aid in the professional growth of local child care and early learning staff and to improve retention rate of participating staff. \nTarget Outreach: Approximately 560 early learning programs are eligible with the goal of awarding at least 2,900 wage supplement applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Measurable Outcome: This activity will be measured by the number of staff who receive wage supplements and the percentage of those who maintain employment after one year. Wage supplements for staff of Texas Rising Star early learning programs will be distributed based on completion of one of more of the following categories: 1) obtainment of Two-, Three-, and Four-Star certification for newly certified programs, star level increases, recertification star level increases, and those that maintain Four-Star after assessment; 2) retention of employment at a Texas Rising Star facility as evidenced through the use of their completed TECPDS account; 3) completion of Ages and Stages Questionnaire for the program and/or classroom Staff; and 4) obtainment of CDA, Associates Degree, Bachelor's Degree, Master's Degree, and Registered Apprenticeship program completion. 5) staff retention bonuses to programs that care for children with disabilities, programs that offer nontraditional hours, and/or programs that are located in desert areas. Data collected will show how many staff were retained throughout the year.  Investing in the growth and knowledge or child care and early learning staff promote a quality classroom environment, and retention will improve consistency in the classroom and quality outcomes.       \nUpdate Q3: Based on actual needs determined, the Board increased funding by $131,000 which supported including staff from underserved programs/areas.

She is currently conducting a needs assessment again in Fall 2024 to learn more about child care program need/suggestions as we move forward. Needs assessments have been completed and data of overall needs and suggestions given by providers have been compiled.\n7) Mentor feedback and observations while working with Entry Level-designated facilities were also taken into account, in addition to information from CLI Engage Texas Rising Star reports, Continuous Quality Improvement Plan (CQIP) goals, assessment scores, and Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS) information.\n8) Child Care Committee review of the draft Quality plan and feedback from members on such was also taken into consideration.\n\nThe Board will measure success in all activities based on numbers of participants, participation noted from this fiscal year over the previous fiscal year, and new/additional center and home participation. The Board will also use increased Texas Rising Star accreditation numbers as a measure of success, along with required staff Texas Rising Star training completion, active participation in mentoring hours for providers working towards accreditation and CQIP progress/goal completion. \n\nAll quality activities align with the Boards strategic plan as they support child care program needs based on obtained feedback/suggestions and are implemented with the intent of promoting and increasing quality child care. In our area, and across the state, we know there is a need for child care workers. We plan to assist child care programs in alleviating staff constraints, thus increasing capacity for CCS children (including infant and toddler space, specifically). This will also be achieved by continuing to offer our Child Development Scholarship opportunity for continuing education at two local junior colleges. Our Board noted that a 1.4% increased need is expected in the child care industry over the next five years. Our Board is encouraging child care workers to get credentialed in the field, that will ultimately help wages to increase in our area. We will also be working with the CCS programs in pursuing and attaining Texas Rising Star certification as required, including offering a variety of professional development opportunities to ensure a wide availability to meet higher hour expectations for Texas Rising Star. Lastly, all activities offered by quality funds will be used to increase the level of quality a child care program can offer and the level of quality care that the children in our area receive.\nWho administers the CCQ funds? | Board\nIf the Board selects \"Both\" from above, describe in detail how this is coordinated.\nInfant & Toddler (including Professional Development)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nInfant and Toddler Expansion - financial stipends | CQF 4% | 72000 | Quarter 2 | Activity: Additional infant and toddler slots were identified as a need again at the statewide Board Strategic Planning Session in August 2024. We know that a lack of infant and toddler slots continues to be a statewide and national concern. Additionally, 9 facilities were given these stipends in 2024 with a confirmed increase of 51 infant/toddler slots. Without Boards assisting local child care programs in these supply building activities (with the cost of opening new classrooms and purchasing materials for these age groups), these expansion activities may not take place. Lastly, with local ISDs continuing to enroll additional 3- and 4-year olds into Preschool and/or Head Start, area child care programs are working to remain competitive in the child care business and increase space availability for younger age children as some of their enrollments for children 3-4 years old are moving into the school system. Additionally, during the needs assessments conducted in late 2024, several child care programs inquired about our Expansion activities, along with any state opportunities that might be available. With all of the industry growth that Grayson County is experiencing specifically, additional expansion activities are a must. This opportunity will also be offered to child care programs currently serving our area to have an opportunity to also meet the needs of the expanding community. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need. In keeping with this identified need, the Texoma Board will work to implement another Infant and Toddler Expansion Initiative in early 2025. \nTarget Outreach: Up to 8-10 facilities may expect assistance with this Expansion Initiative with by financial stipends. This activity may generate up to 8 additional slots for each participating facility (up to $8,000 at $1,000 per slot x 8 facilities = $64,000). This activity has the potential to generate up to an additional 64 infant and toddler slots.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure this activity's success by the number of child care programs that increase or add additional infant and toddler slots to their already existing capacity. If at least two child care programs increases their infant and toddler capacity from this Initiative, it will be considered successful.\nInfant and Toddler specific professional development session | CQF 4% | 500 | Quarter 2 | Activity: Adding a professional development training specifically for the needs of infant and toddlers will assist teaching staff of these age groups learn the most current early childhood education information for these ages, thus increasing the quality of care they can provide to the children in their classes. This infant/toddler specific professional development opportunity correlates to the Infant and Toddler Expansion (supply building) opportunity. As area child care programs work to remain competitive with area ISDs further enrolling 3-4 year olds into Preschool and/or HeadStart, child care programs must attempt to adapt and are working to increase their infant and toddler capacity since they have lost some 3-4 year old enrollments. Thus, furthering the need for infant and toddler specific training topics. In fact, infant and toddler specific trainings have been requested on our annual professional development survey repeatedly. We continue to have age specific training requests, mostly concerning infant and toddler topics.  As brain development at this young age is such a critical time of development, needs assessment responses have included requests for infant and toddler topics. This training also aligns with the Child Care Quality initiatives to support infant and toddler quality that was identified as a need at both Board Strategic Planning Conferences. Lastly, child care program staff will be assisted in meeting the higher professional development hour expectation with Texas Rising Star certification, all while receiving high quality, local training. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need.\nTarget Outreach: It is anticipated that at least 25 people will attend this training event.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success with this activity by the number of child care programs that attend the event. If at least 10 child care programs participate and increase their early childhood development knowledge specific to infants and toddlers, this training will be considered successful.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 72500\nProfessional Development\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nProfessional Development | CQF 4% | 33150 | Quarter 1 | Activity: These professional development activities meet the continual need for required professional development hours and to ensure child care program staff can meet the higher hour expectation with Texas Rising Star certification, all while receiving high quality, local training. The Board will provide monthly trainings, a Super Saturday Conference, and other identified Professional Development offerings throughout the year, including a few virtual offerings. For the last few years, our Board has conducted an annual professional development survey. From these survey responses, a professional development training plan is developed (usually by the quarter) to implement identified training needs from the survey and to incorporate those needs into one of our monthly or other professional development offerings. Our annual training offerings are aligned with professional development needs identified by the survey respondents and other feedback gathered from the training event evaluation forms and comments. These trainings are convenient, local, and a low-cost way for child care programs to help them meet their required training hours while increasing their knowledge of quality child development best practices.\nTarget Outreach: It is anticipated that at least 15 people will attend each monthly training offered and that at least 60 will attend our Super Saturday conference.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success with these activities by the number of child care programs that attend each event. If at least 15 child care programs participate and increase their early childhood development knowledge (or at least 60 at the Super Saturday conference), each training offered will be considered successful.\nConference Reimbursement | CQF 4% | 4000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: These professional development activities meet the continual need for required professional development hours and to ensure child care program staff can meet the higher hour expectation with Texas Rising Star certification, all while receiving high quality, mostly local training. Offering reimbursement to such events ensures child care programs have the ability to receive training activities from well-rounded sources. The Board will provide reimbursements to TLCCA, Camp Fire, Region 10 ESC Conferences, TXAEYC, and Frog Street Press' Splash Conference. Offering partial reimbursements to area high-quality, well-rounded and respected source sponsored training activities, provides a means for child care programs and staff to attend professional development events that they might not normally be able to attend due to financial limitations. The Texoma Board is proud to support child care programs and these quality agencies in offering this partial reimbursement opportunity for more rural programs that might not otherwise have such an opportunity. These conference reimbursement opportunities are requested each year by some of our area programs from the needs assessments and are treated as an incentive for high performing staff. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need.\nTarget Outreach: It is anticipated that at least 4 facilities with a total of 10 staff will request reimbursement for attending one of these conferences.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success with these activities by the number of child care programs that seek the partial reimbursement opportunity for their attendance at one of the noted conferences. If at least 3 facilities with a total of 8 staff request reimbursement for attending one of these conferences, this activity will be considered successful.\nChild Development Scholarships | CQF 4% | 40500 | Quarter 1 | Activity: Offering Child Development Scholarship opportunities in our Board area through two local junior colleges allows continual professional development and knowledge growth in child development to further assist with teacher knowledge, the quality of care they offer, and ultimately a potential increase in Child Care Services capacity with more educated teachers/staff. The more educated, dedicated and consistent staff a child care program can employ, that facility, as well as the children in care and the community as a whole, benefit. The Texoma Board is providing a means for more child care staff to attain a CDA National Credential, Child Development Certificate, or even as associates degree, that might not be able to attend otherwise due to financial limitations. This activity also relates to the nationwide concern of advocacy organizations that say the public as a whole does not view the child care industry as professionals. This activity works to assist in addressing this issue by elevating the education and teacher/staffing standard in our community. The local match Agreements are mutually beneficial for the Board and the participating community colleges, as well as the community. This continued partnership was identified as a need by the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and the Scholarships are an integral part of this relationship. The scholarships foster continual growth of the individuals who go through the program and are noted by directors from the needs assessment as a benefit to their staff. This is a financial benefit to the child care program as well to offer this to their staff and serves as a source of pride to many. Directors have stated that these scholarships are a continual need.\nTarget Outreach: 10 to 25 participants from approximately 8 facilities.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success with this activity if at least 10 participants take courses for their Child Development Associate National Credential, Child Development Certificate, or Associate Degree.  Additionally, successful completions in these programs will be reviewed. The Board will measure this activity by the number of participants of at least 10 participants, including 3 successful completions.\nChild Development Educational Attainment Completion Incentive | CQF 4% | 5000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: The Board will once again offer an incentive for Child Development Scholarship students for obtaining a credential or certificate in the Child Development program at a local community college. These incentives will be used to further strengthen the students resolve in completing the program and align with our Boards plan to continually push quality improvement and continuing education and to increase the level of professionalism in our community through staff education. Unfortunately, the child care industry does see a lot of turnover due to the lower pay that is offered. This activity works to assist those teachers/staff complete an educational program they may not otherwise have the opportunity to take on. The incentive is offered to encourage completion of the program and the Texoma Board will continue to offer this opportunity as allowable. As stated during the needs assessments, directors are encouraging staff to participate in the scholarship program, to complete an educational program, and to earn an incentive for completion. The majority of the centers would never be able to financially reward their staff and are fully aware of the value of this program. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need.\nTarget Outreach: Up to 20 participants\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for this activity if at least 4 students successfully earn a credential or certificate and receive an education attainment completion incentive. The Board will measure the number of child care program staff that earn an incentive for completing a credential or certificate.\nStaff Retention Incentive (related to Educational Attainment) | CQF 4% | 4000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: The Board will once again offer an incentive for Child Development Scholarship students for employment retention after successfully obtaining a credential or certificate in the Child Development program at a local community college through the Child Development Scholarship program we offer. These incentives will be offered to successful completers only within the Child Development Scholarship program that maintain employment at the same facility from when they completed the educational program at 3 and 6 months of continued employment and will add an additional incentive for continued employment to these completers at a 12-month employment timeline. These incentives will be used to further strengthen the students resolve in completing the program maintain employment at the current child care facility, and align with our Boards plan to continually push quality improvement and continuing education. Unfortunately, staff often leave local child care facilities for ISDs after attaining their certificate or degree and this staff retention incentive assists in helping facilities retain quality staff for a longer period of time. As stated during the needs assessments, directors are encouraging staff to participate in the scholarship program, to complete an educational program, to earn an incentive for completion and to continue to earn incentives for employment retention. In fact, some child care programs are concerned that staff may leave after completing an educational program, but are encouraged by the implementation of this employment retention incentive. The majority of the centers would never be able to financially reward their staff and are fully aware of the value of this program. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need.\nTarget Outreach: Up to 20 participants\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for this activity if at least 4 students successfully earn a credential or certificate and receive an staff retention incentive. The Board will measure the number of child care program staff that earn an incentive for staff retention based on educational attainment.\nChild Development Associate (CDA) National Credential Application Fee and Renewal Fee Reimbursements | CQF 4% | 14625 | Quarter 1 | Activity: Continual professional development and knowledge growth in child development and early childhood to further assist with teacher knowledge and Child Care Services capacity expansion and professionalism. The Texoma Board works to further encourage attainment and continued maintenance of CDA national credentials in our Board area. This activity has two parts:\n1. Offer reimbursements for CDA Certificate renewal fees ($125) and 2. Offer reimbursements for CDA Certificate application fees ($425).\nIn conjunction with the Child Development Scholarships, this activity further supports this initiative and area child care programs by encouraging follow through and attainment of the CDA National Certificate. Often times, the application fee is cost-prohibitive for child care staff and facilities due to low wages, young staff, etc. Furthermore, assistance with the renewal fee encourages staff to maintain their CDA national certificate once it is attained. Again, the ultimate goal is a continual push towards higher professionalism in the child care industry and higher educated staff that offer a higher level of quality care. As stated during the needs assessments, directors are supportive of the continuation of this activity to further encourage their staff to pursue the CDA National credential and/or retain the certificate once achieved. The majority of the centers would never be able to financially assist their staff and are fully aware of the value of this program. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need.\nTarget Outreach: Up to 10 participants\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure this activity as successful if at least 5 child care facility's utilize this reimbursement opportunity to increase their staff's continued child development and early education knowledge and CDA national credential attainment. The Board will measure this activity by the number of facilities that seek reimbursement for their staff, of at least 5.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 101275\nTexas Rising Star/Quality Improvement (except Professional Development; include Texas Rising Star personnel)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nTexas Rising Star  Staff  Personnel Costs | CCQ 2% | 344916 | Quarter 1 | Activity: Mentoring functions will continue with certified Texas Rising Star programs, along with interested CCS programs because of House Bill 2607, identified as Entry Level designated. Funds will be used to strongly support mentoring activities at new facilities working towards Texas Rising Star certification. Mentors will encourage, strengthen and give guidance on current and quality early childhood education practices. \nTarget Outreach: The estimated reach of this activity is up to 47 child care programs.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success if all currently certified Texas Rising Star facilities (26) maintain Texas Rising Star certification, while offering mentoring activities to at least 10 additional facilities pursuing Texas Rising Star certification. The Board will measure this activity's outcome by the number of facilities that obtain mentor activities.\nOutreach Materials (banners, decals, and brochures, etc.) | CCQ 2% | 2150 | Quarter 2 | Activity: The Board will continue to supply Texas Rising Star programs and prospective facilities with information and marketing materials regarding the Texas Rising Star program as it relates to House Bill 2607 and those seeking higher level quality of care for their facility. Banners, decals, and brochures may be provided.\nTarget Outreach: Up to 29 facilities.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for this activity if at least 15 facilities obtain Texas Rising Star certification this fiscal year and receive appropriate outreach and marketing materials for the Texas Rising Star program. The Board will measure the number of facilities that obtain Texas Rising Star certification and receive the appropriate outreach and marketing materials.\nMaterials/equipment/\ndevelopmental resources | CQF 4% | 16800 | Quarter 2 | Activity: In an effort to further support child care programs in achieving a higher level of quality care, and ultimately Texas Rising Star certification, the Board will support programs pursuing Texas Rising Star certification with developmental resources. The Texoma Board plans to provide resources to help facilities attain Texas Rising Star certification by providing mentor recommended resources that can be expensive. These resources relates specifically to Categories 2 and 4, and relate to social-emotional and classroom management supports that have been identified as the highest need by area Texas Rising Star mentors. These resources will provide more children of all socio-economic backgrounds with high quality resources to learn and play. Additional developmental resources are a particular need for small (non-corporate owned) facilities and homes. Child care programs have also identified resource items that they stated were a need for them as assistance in meeting Texas Rising Star measures during onsite program visits. The items to be purchased have been identified as a need from area child care trainers and mentors to align with professional development activities that have already been conducted. For example, a training was held on transitions and the mentors requested tools to support implementation of smooth transitions. These transitions further support the children in preparation for elementary school. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need.\nTarget Outreach: Up to 29 facilities\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for this activity if at least 10 facilities receive materials/equipment/developmental resources to support their pursuit and preparation for the initial assessment for the Texas Rising Star program. The Board will measure the number of facilities that receive developmental resources in support of their preparation for the initial assessment for the Texas Rising Star program.\nTexas Rising Star Maintenance Support Incentives | CCQ 2% | 66713 | Quarter 4 | Activity: In an effort to further assist Texas Rising Star programs with maintaining their certification status, the Board will give a maintenance support incentive to current Texas Rising Star programs. Furthermore, Texas Rising Star programs that are working to increase their star level beyond a Two-Star or Three-Star can use these supportive funds to work towards that goal by purchasing needed equipment and/or materials that might be missing to assist with meeting measure expectations.\nTarget outreach: Up to 26 Texas Rising Star programs.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for this activity if the current Texas Rising Star programs (26) continue to maintain their Texas Rising Star certification and if at least one facility increases their star level from a Two-Star to Three-Star, or up to a Four-Star. The Board will measures the number of facilities that continue to maintain their Texas Rising Star certification and determine if at least one facility increases their star level from a Two-Star to Three-Star, or up to a Four-Star.\nTexas Rising Star Initial Certification Incentive | CQF 4% | 22000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: This activity aligns with the Boards continual push for quality improvement. This will further support the Boards goal of increasing the level of quality care in the service area, while also working towards meeting the House Bill 2607 requirement by attaining Texas Rising Star certification within 24-months. The Texoma Board will offer this financial incentive to centers and homes that successfully attain certification using the scale below. This incentive is a financial support for their hard work and achievement. It also serves as a nice, but minimal buffer for those programs that may not receive a higher daily rate if their published rates are lower than the Board max rate, even with the Texas Rising Star star-level. The incentive is paid after Texas Rising Star attainment is confirmed. As with the earned incentives for educational attainment, this incentive is for the programs that have earned Texas Rising Star certification. Texas Rising Star mentors have noted the need for such incentives to continually encourage the programs to keep going in the long process of certification. These funds encourage programs to attain, maintain, and/or improve their star level rating within the program. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need.\nTwo-Star achieved = $1,500 (Centers) and $750 (Homes)\nThree-Star achieved = $1,000 (Centers) and $500 (Homes)\nFour-Star achieved = $500 (Centers) and $250 (Homes)\nTarget Outreach: Up to 29 facilities.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for this activity if at least 15 facilities obtain Texas Rising Star certification this fiscal year and receive the corresponding incentive for Texas Rising Star level certification. The Board will measure the number of facilities that obtain Texas Rising Star accreditation and receive the corresponding incentive.\nMaterials and Equipment for the STEAM Initiative \n(5th year, Math will be the focus) | CCQ 2% | 14000 | Quarter 2 | Activity: This activity aligns with assisting child care programs to further increase the quality of care they provide in their facility by offering quality supplies and a fun activity to further the children's knowledge and experiences. As this will be the fifth year of the initiative, \"Math\" will be the focus. Two age groups may participate, ages 3-5 (a class activity) and ages 6-12 (an individual activity).\nTarget Outreach: Up to 20 facilities.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for this activity if at least 8 facilities participate in this STEAM Project. The Board will measure the number of facilities that participate in the STEAM Project.\nMaterials and Equipment for the Literacy Initiative | CCQ 2% | 14000 | Quarter 3 | Activity: This activity aligns with assisting child care programs to further increase the quality of care they provide in their facility by offering quality supplies (educational books) to further the children's knowledge and experiences. Two age groups may participate, ages 3-5 (a class activity) and ages 6-12 (an individual activity). This literacy initiative is an opportunity for the Texoma Board to provide books for centers and home that might not have the financial means to purchase them. This activity encourages literacy and provides ideas for simple, pre-planned activities that can be built upon or used in different ways to support learning and literacy efforts at a young age.\nTarget Outreach: Up to 20 facilities.\nMeasurable Outcomes: The Board will measure success for this activity if at least 8 facilities participate in this activity. The Board will measure the number of facilities that participate in the activity.\nMaterials and Equipment Reimbursement Grant | CQF 4% | 115000 | Quarter 4 | Activity: Texoma will offer a general Child Care Quality Reimbursement Grant to all child care programs in our service area. This reimbursement grant will be used to support and/or increase developmental resources, equipment, material, and/or curriculum needs of each facility. This further aligns with the Boards strategic plan to continually increase the level of quality child care programs give and the level of care the children receive. Offering programs this financial support to ensure quality equipment, manipulatives, materials, etc. are available to programs that would not otherwise be able to afford to replace, provide, or add items to their facility. This helps with purchasing quality items, learning materials, and curriculum that align with their specific needs and support Texas Rising Star requirements. For those where it is cost prohibitive, it frees up funds for the small business to make other improvements, raise salaries, or making a living wage for themselves. In our Board area, only 2-3 programs are owned by corporations, the overwhelming majority are small business owners. Per WD Letter 16-24, Change 1, playground equipment, shade structures, cameras, or other security equipment, and smart boards would be excluded. Furthermore, offering child care programs an opportunity to obtain new equipment will allow the facilities to maintain a safe environment with quality learning resources that can be cost prohibitive. During needs assessment visits, it is apparent that continued support of such reimbursement grant opportunities is an on-going need. Directors state that this continues to be a need for them as they update old tables and chairs, cribs, or open a new learning center with these grants. Directors state that they must be able to provide age appropriate equipment and materials and can not always do so without this opportunity. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need.\nTarget Outreach: Up to 30 child care facilities.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for this activity if at least 20 facilities are awarded a Quality Reimbursement Grant. The Board will measure the number of facilities that receive an award for the Quality Reimbursement Grant.\nOutdoor Equipment and/or Office Equipment Reimbursement Grant | CQF 4% | 101423 | Quarter 2 | Activity: Texoma will offer a Child Care Quality Reimbursement Grant specifically for outdoor equipment and/or office equipment to all child care programs in our service area. This reimbursement grant will be used to support and/or increase developmental resources, equipment, and material needs of each facility. This further aligns with the Boards strategic plan to continually increase the level of quality child care programs give and the level of care the children receive. Furthermore, this would align with area needs for Category 4 outdoor classroom measures. Outdoor equipment and office equipment (technology) can be cost prohibitive and will provide an opportunity for small businesses to have the technology necessary to communicate with parents (tablets, etc.) and stay up to date on critical communication from Child Care Regulation, TWC, etc. The technology could also be used to support staff professional development training and educational opportunities (for example, on a laptop). In our Board area, only 2-3 programs are owned by corporations, the overwhelming majority are small business owners. \nPer WD Letter 16-24, Change 1, playground equipment, shade structures, cameras, or other security equipment, and smart boards would be excluded. Furthermore, offering child care programs an opportunity to obtain new resources for both outdoor classrooms and play environments will allow the facilities to maintain a safe environment with quality learning resources that can be cost prohibitive. During needs assessment visits, a vast majority of child care programs stated a need for improvement or additions in their outdoor learning areas. Outdoor learning environments align with Texas Rising Star requirements so this will further support meeting the applicable measures. An opportunity for office equipment support is a need for programs also to assist in supporting with staff records, TECPDS, Child Care Regulation requirements, Texas Rising Star requirements, and attendance review and tracking. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need.\nTarget Outreach: Up to 30 childcare facilities.\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for this activity if at least 15 facilities are awarded a Quality Reimbursement Grant.  The Board will measure the number of facilities that receive an award for the Quality Reimbursement Grant.\nChild Care Business Services Specialist Liaison Personnel Costs | CCQ 2% | 35000 | Quarter 1 | Activity: The Child Care Business Services Specialist works with child care programs in our service area to ensure quality needs are being met and that program needs are being addressed by the Board. Staff work with programs in identifying special needs and bringing issues of concern to mentors and/or local CCS staff. Other administrative duties within the Fiscal Department related to child care will be processed and oversight by the Child Care Contracts Manager will occur. This staff person provides outreach and one-on-one support to child care programs and future programs. They provide resources to those in need and connect programs with the necessary source of assistance. This person works to recruit non-CCS programs and find ways that programs need support from our Board area through consistent communication and ensure that we are providing meaningful resources and assistance and share feedback with Board staff.\nThe Texoma Board area has 86 child care programs either registered or licensed through Child Care Regulation. Of those, 56 are Child Care Services programs (65%).\nTarget Outreach: All child care programs in our Board area (86 programs).\nMeasurable Outcome: The Board will measure success for this activity if current Texas Rising Star programs are able to maintain their certification, if star levels are increased for those at Two-Star and Three-Star levels, and if the number of Child Care Services programs in our Board area grows. The Board will measure the number of certified facilities that are able to maintain their certification (26), and if at least 1 facility increases their star level from a Two-Star, to a Three-Star, or a Four-Star level, and if the number of CCS programs in our Board area increases by 1 or more during this fiscal year.\nTotal Planned Estimated Expenditures | 732002\nSupporting Health & Safety Standards (except Professional Development)\nActivity Type/Name | Type of Funding\n(Check all that apply) | Planned Estimated Expenditures | Anticipated Quarter Start | Narrative Description of Planned Activities \nDescription must include estimated number of reach and type of participant, alignment to what need or Board strategy, which quarter(s) the activity will be implemented, and measurable outcome\nCPR/First-Aid Training Reimbursement | CCQ 2% | 16875 | Quarter 1 | Activity: This aligns with the Board's plan to continually support ongoing professional development activities for staff at Texas Rising Star facilities.

The Texoma Board will continue to offer this as a renewal opportunity to encourage participation and to increase quality mindedness in our three-county area. As everyone is aware, national certification can be costly (up to $2,500 for each designation annually), especially for small businesses and homes, and the Board appreciates the opportunity to support child care programs in this way. At this time, due to ownership changes, we now only have 1 CCS program in our Board area that has successfully been able to maintain their national accreditation. The Board wants to continue to support child care programs maintaining this accreditation as long as the program continues the work to do so.  From direct program communication, it has been noted that the only remaining nationally accredited facility in our area appreciates our assistance with the cost of the renewal fees. Without our Board's assistance, this facility may struggle to maintain the cost of this accreditation. This quality activity was presented to the Child Care Committee on 9/18/24 and confirmed by them as a need.\nTarget Outreach: 1 child care program\nMeasurable Outcome: If at least 1 facility requests partial reimbursement for National accreditation and/or renewal fees, the Board will consider this a successful activity.
