These programs are part of the child care system managed by the Texas Workforce Commission. Child care places that meet certain rules get a Texas Rising Star certificate. This recognition goes to centers and homes that do things well. We assess how good they are with kids and rank them with 2, 3, or 4 stars. More stars mean better quality. When a program gets Texas Rising Star certification, it means they provide care above the minimum standards. They have well-trained staff, teachers who interact and work well with children, and they manage operations effectively. Their indoor and outdoor learning spaces are also above minimum standards. These programs help children learn when they're young. And as they earn more stars, they make an even greater difference in children's lives every day. Learn more at TexasRisingStar.org .

    "text": "There aren't enough teachers for child care and early learning programs right now. Work-based learning can help programs hire and retain great teachers. Work-based learning lets programs employ teachers while they go to school. Here are some ways to use work-based learning to find and keep teachers: Hire high school or college students as interns or assistant teachers which may count toward classroom teacher-to-child ratios. Help child care teachers who are currently attending school find scholarships. Create or join a Registered Apprenticeship Program (RAP). Learn more about work-based learning opportunities in Module 7: Professional Development and Business Opportunities, Part 1 of Texas Workforce Commission's (TWC) Child Care Workforce Support Series Recruitment Many high school career programs and college programs have students interested in working in child care. You can contact these programs to help identify interested candidates. High School Career & Technical Education Through High School Career & Technical Education (CTE) programs of study, students can earn a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential. For more information about the Early Learning Program of Study, visit CTE Programs . You can use the CTE Mapping Application to find high schools in your area that offer Early Learning CTE programs. You can find more information about how high school students can count toward your teacher-to-child ratios in the Child Care Minimum Standards (page 73). College Early Childhood Education Courses Colleges offer College Early Childhood Education (ECE) courses that require students to work in an early childhood setting.

T.E.A.C.H. offers scholarships to students working in child care programs and pursuing further education in early childhood education. To shorten the time it takes to get a degree, some colleges count coursework from a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential towards an associate degree. And some colleges count credits from an associate degree towards a bachelor's degree. Different colleges have different policies on credit transfers. You can learn more by contacting the college. These colleges may count CDA coursework towards an associate or bachelor's degree: Angelina College Austin Community College Central Texas College Collin County College Dallas College Houston Community College Lamar Institute of Technology McLennan Community College Odessa College San Antonio College San Jacinto College South Texas College Tarleton State University Tarrant County College Texas A&M at San Antonio Note: This list is current as of January 2023.

    "text": "What is a Pre-K Partnership? A pre-k partnership is when a school partners with one or more quality child care programs to give quality care and education to 3- and 4-year-old children. Child care programs must meet at least one of the criteria in Texas Education Code §29.171 to be eligible for a formal pre-k partnership. Formal Partnerships In a formal pre-k partnership, children are a part of both public-school pre-k and the child care program. They stay at the child care center for, pre-k instruction and before- and after-school care. These partnerships are useful for families with working parents and help children have consistent care and learning. The teacher leading the pre-k part of the class can work for the school or the child care program and needs to meet specific standards. Child care programs and schools can support pre-k partnerships with money from different sources. For example, TWC's Child Care Services (CCS) program may pay for the care some children receive before and after the pre-k class. If these children get pre-k for half a day (prek-3) and 6 hours or more of care, the center may get their full-day CCS payment rate. If a child gets a full day of pre-k (prek-4) and less than 6 hours of care, the center may get a lower payment rate. Schools might also divide state funds such as Average Daily Attendance and Early Education Allotment with child care programs. This helps cover the costs of teaching pre-k in the partnership classroom. For more information about possible funding, check the Texas Education Agency (TEA) website . Example of a Formal PreK-3 Partnership Informal Partnerships In informal partnerships, a school and a child care program share resources and information. This includes things like learning opportunities for teachers, what children need to be ready for school, and ways to involve families. In informal partnerships, children are not signed up for both public school pre-k and the child care program. So, there is no money passed from the school to the child care program. Even so, informal partnerships can be a good start to making a formal pre-k partnership later. Pre-K Eligibility To be eligible for public school pre-k, a child needs to be 3 or 4 years old by September 1 of the current school year and meet at least one of these conditions: Educationally Disadvantaged - Child is eligible for the free/reduced meal program or receives SNAP, Medicaid, or TANF. Limited English Proficiency - Child is unable to speak and comprehend the English language. Military - Child whose parent is currently in the armed forces, including state military forces or a reserve component. It also includes a child whose parent was hurt or died while serving on active duty in the armed forces. Homeless - Child qualifies as defined by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. Foster Care - Child is in or has ever been in foster care in Texas or another state. Star of Texas Award - Child of a police officer, firefighter, or emergency medical responder seriously injured or killed in the line of duty. Classroom Teacher - Child of a person that teaches at a school district that offers pre-k. For more information about pre-k eligibility requirements, please refer to Texas Education Code §29.153(b) . Benefits of Pre-K Partnerships Pre-k partnerships may benefit children, families, and educators by: Increasing access to high-quality care and pre-k Offering consistency between the school day and before/after care Keeping or growing enrollment of 3- and 4-year-old children Increasing resources and training for teachers Supporting children to help them prepare for school What We Do Information Grants & Funding Education & Training Services Email the Pre-K Partnership Team To learn more about partnerships & how we can help create a partnership that suits your needs, email prekpartnerships@twc.texas ... TWC Pre-K Partnership Team The Pre-K Partnership Team at TWC is committed to helping child care providers and schools establish pre-k partnerships. This involves: Reaching out to potential partners Finding matches Assisting partners during talks Providing resources Eligible child care providers working with the TWC Pre-K Partnership team can apply for a one-time award of up to $25,000 for each new partnership classroom. The award will help child care providers with some of the costs of the new pre-k partnership classroom. The money is not intended to replace the contributions from the school. Applications for the award open annually on September 1st and close on January 15th. TWC will invite child care providers to apply for funding once they: Are Texas Rising Star 3- or 4-Star certified; Have a contract with a school for a formal pre-k partnership; Have a new pre-k partnership classroom in operation with dually enrolled students getting before- and after-school care at the child care program; and Attend a virtual funding information session (by TWC invite only) Child care providers that did not work with TWC during the development of their pre-k partnership should contact the TWC Pre-K Partnership team to determine if they are eligible for the award.
