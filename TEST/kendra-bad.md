Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.

### Q2: Which Texas agencies are primarily responsible for child care operations during disasters, and what are their specific roles?
**A2:** Two agencies share primary responsibility: The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) serves as the lead state agency for administering CCDF child care subsidies and coordinates with 28 Local Workforce Development Boards. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission's (HHSC) Child Care Regulation (CCR) division regulates all child care operations in Texas and serves as the primary contact and point of coordination for child care providers during emergencies. CCR tracks provider closures, promulgates emergency rules, approves waivers, and authorizes temporary relocations.

### Q3: What emergency provisions can TWC staff implement for families receiving child care subsidies without needing Commission approval?
**A3:** TWC staff can direct Local Boards to implement several emergency provisions for families for up to three months without Commission action, including: extension of CCDF eligibility recertification periods for affected families, extension of the three-month period of continued child care for parents displaced from employment/education/training, exceptions to attendance reporting requirements when failure was beyond parent control, and exceptions to attendance standards for disaster-related absences.

### Q4: How long can TWC provide continued reimbursements to affected child care providers after a disaster without Commission approval?
**A4:** TWC staff may direct Boards to implement continued reimbursements to affected providers for up to four weeks without Commission action. This is part of a broader set of emergency provisions for CCDF providers that can be implemented during the immediate aftermath of a disaster to support provider recovery.

### Q5: What is the Texas Child Care Availability Portal and how is it used during disasters?
**A5:** The Texas Child Care Availability Portal is a communication tool that TWC and CCR coordinate to use during disasters. Providers that are open and operating use the portal to enter information about their available child care slots, while families who have lost access to child care use it to locate available care that meets their needs. TWC can also leverage the portal to collect data about disaster response needs, such as requirements for personal protective equipment or other supplies.

### Q6: What types of emergency preparedness plans are child care providers required to maintain under Texas regulations?
**A6:** Child care providers must have written emergency preparedness plans that include procedures for: evacuating children to safe areas (with specific procedures for infants under 24 months and children with disabilities); communication plans with local authorities, parents, and CCR; evacuating with essential documentation including parent contacts, emergency authorization, and child tracking information; continuing care until children are released; reunifying children with parents after the emergency; and conducting regular practice drills (monthly fire drills and quarterly severe weather and lockdown drills).

### Q7: What role do Local Workforce Development Boards play in disaster recovery for child care services?
**A7:** Boards play a key role in assisting disaster-affected communities by providing information, referrals, and access to resources for affected individuals and businesses. Workforce Solutions Offices help connect parents and child care providers with various assistance programs including FEMA assistance, TWC Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Small Business Administration resources, HHS programs, the Texas Child Care Availability Portal, DSHS emergency preparedness resources (Texas Ready), Help Me Grow Texas, and Child Care Health Consultants.

### Q8: How can CCDF quality funds be used to support child care providers after a disaster?
**A8:** Under TWC's Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule and federal regulations, CCDF funds designated for quality activities may be used for minor remodeling and improvements to ensure providers meet state and local standards. During disasters, Boards may use local CCDF quality funds to help providers restore or remediate facilities or replace damaged and destroyed property such as classroom materials and furnishings. The Commission may also allocate state-level funds for facility repairs, replacement of damaged property, subsidies for essential workers' children, protective care subsidies, and capacity-building initiatives.

### Q9: What emergency provisions are available specifically for Texas Rising Star (TRS) providers during disaster recovery?
**A9:** TWC staff can direct Boards to implement several emergency provisions for TRS providers for up to four weeks without Commission action, including: short-term assistance during recovery, exceptions to quarterly screening requirements, extension of scheduled assessments, and temporary suspension of unannounced monitoring visits. These provisions help maintain TRS certification status while providers focus on recovery efforts.

### Q10: What free training and technical assistance resources are available to help child care providers prepare for emergencies?
**A10:** Providers can access several free resources through HHSC's website, including: Texas A&M AgriLife Extension trainings (Child Care and COVID-19 Courses, Emergency Planning for Child Care Providers, and Emergency Preparedness for Children with Special Needs), CCDBG Rule Changes interactive presentations on emergency preparedness requirements, Hurricane Preparedness Plans checklist, www.TexasReady.gov step-by-step emergency planning guide, and Emergency Preparedness Reminder information from CCR. Additionally, CCR requires providers to maintain liability insurance and provides information about the Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS) to protect records and assets.

## child-care-workforce-strategic-plan-qa.md

### Q2: What are the three main strategic goals outlined in the Texas Child Care Workforce Strategic Plan?
**A2:** The three main strategic goals are: (1) **Expand the Child Care Workforce** - focusing on recruiting new workers, retaining current staff, and supporting re-entry of former workers through strategies like workforce development programs and career pathway initiatives; (2) **Strengthen the Child Care Workforce** - emphasizing professional development, educational opportunities, and credential attainment through TECPDS and other support systems; and (3) **Support the Child Care Workforce** - addressing compensation, benefits, working conditions, and overall job satisfaction to create sustainable careers in early childhood education.

### Q4: How is child care primarily funded in Texas, and what role does the Child Care Services (CCS) program play?
**A4:** Child care in Texas is primarily funded through private family payments, which account for approximately 85% of all child care funding in the state. The Child Care Services (CCS) program, funded through the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), provides subsidized child care assistance to eligible low-income families but currently serves only about 12% of eligible children due to funding limitations. This heavy reliance on private payments creates affordability challenges for families and sustainability challenges for providers trying to maintain adequate staffing and compensation levels.

### Q6: What are the key demographic characteristics of Texas's child care workforce according to the Director Survey?
**A6:** The Director Survey reveals that the Texas child care workforce is overwhelmingly female (approximately 95%) and racially/ethnically diverse, with significant representation of Hispanic/Latino workers. The workforce spans various age groups, with many educators in their 30s and 40s, though there's also representation of younger workers entering the field and more experienced educators. Educational attainment varies widely, from high school diplomas to bachelor's degrees and beyond, with many workers pursuing additional credentials while employed. The survey also indicates that many educators work in the field because of their passion for working with children, despite the relatively low compensation.

### Q7: What percentage of child care educators hold specific educational credentials, and what gaps exist?
**A7:** The Director Survey found that approximately 35% of child care educators hold a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential or higher-level early childhood credential, while about 20% have an associate degree or higher in early childhood education or a related field. However, significant gaps remain, with many educators lacking formal early childhood credentials despite having general education credentials. The strategic plan identifies increasing credential attainment as a priority, particularly for the CDA credential, which is recognized nationally and can serve as a stepping stone to higher education in the field.

### Q9: What are the primary barriers to expanding child care capacity in Texas, and what is the estimated economic impact?
**A9:** The primary barriers to expanding capacity include workforce shortages (inability to hire and retain qualified staff), inadequate compensation and benefits that make it difficult to compete with other industries, regulatory requirements that must be met for staffing ratios, and limited physical infrastructure. The plan cites research indicating that inadequate child care access costs Texas an estimated $8.74 billion annually in lost economic activity due to parents being unable to work or working reduced hours. Workforce challenges are identified as the most critical barrier, as facilities often have physical space available but cannot serve additional children without adequate staffing.

### Q11: How does TWC support professional development for early childhood educators?
**A11:** TWC supports professional development through multiple initiatives: (1) $1.5 million over the 2022-2023 biennium for scholarships through the TXAEYC T.E.A.C.H. program for CDA certificates, degrees, and apprenticeships; (2) $500,000 transferred to TEA for ECE partnership projects and teacher stipends; (3) $11.7 million transferred to TEA annually for the Texas School Ready project; (4) Annual Texas Rising Star Early Educator Conferences (714 attendees in 2022); (5) Child Care Business Accelerator program with over 4,900 participants as of September 2022.

### Q14: What is the Child Care Provider Expansion Initiative and what are its goals?
**A14:** In 2022, the Commission approved $150 million in CRRSA and ARPA funding to increase the number of high-quality home- and center-based child care providers. The initiative includes: funding for CCR navigators to support new providers through licensing; funding to Boards for business outreach staffing; and start-up funding (CCPEI) for programs in child care deserts, programs partnering with local employers, and state infant care. As of November 2022, 125 applications were approved for more than $7 million, proposing to open 6,136 new child care spaces, including 3,191 for infant care.

### Q19: What collaborative groups and initiatives does TWC participate in to improve early childhood services?
**A19:** TWC participates in numerous collaborative efforts including: Texas Early Learning Council (TELC), TELC Data Workgroup exploring early childhood integrated data systems, Early Childhood Interagency Work Group with TEA/DFPS/DSHS/HHSC, Early Childhood Texas website partnership, Texas Head Start State Collaboration Office Advisory Board, Early Childhood Intervention Advisory Committee, TECPDS Advisory Council, Virtual Collaborative Symposiums with HHSC CCR (300 participants each), and the ECE Business Collaboratory with 15 state teams.

### Q20: What stakeholder input methods does TWC use for its child care program?
**A20:** TWC gathers stakeholder input through multiple channels: Tri-Agency Workforce Initiative (230 respondents), Texas Early Childhood Integrated Data System Focus Groups (eight virtual listening sessions in August 2022), stakeholder-led engagement activities with groups like Texas Prenatal-Three Collaborative and Children at Risk's Early Childhood Education Coalition, TWC-led listening sessions and webinars for rule amendments and state plan development, and regular meetings between CC&EL leadership and Boards and statewide advocacy groups. The Commission approved a policy in October 2019 outlining opportunities for stakeholders to provide input, which is summarized on the TWC website.

### Q3: How much funding did the Commission recommend allocating in the Fifth Tranche, and what was the remaining balance after these recommendations?
**A3:** The Fifth Tranche recommended allocating $1,098,545,000 across six major initiative areas. This brought the total approved funding across all tranches to $5,723,507,696, leaving a remaining balance of $211,642,819 from the total $5.9 billion appropriated.

## Issue 1: Outreach and Education Campaigns

### Q13: What is a "child care desert" as defined in the Texas Labor Code, and how much funding was recommended for capacity-building in these areas?
**A13:** According to Texas Labor Code §302.0461, a child care desert is defined as an area of the state where the number of children with working parents younger than six is three times greater than the licensed child care capacity. The Fifth Tranche recommended $75 million total for capacity-building grants, which includes funding for child care desert capacity expansion, infant capacity expansion, and employer site-based child care.

### Q18: What restrictions exist on the use of CCDF funds for capacity-building projects?
**A18:** CCDF funds cannot be used for construction, major renovations, or the purchase or improvement of land. Major renovation is specifically defined as: (1) structural changes to the foundation, roof, floor, exterior or load-bearing walls of a facility, or the extension of a facility to increase its floor area; or (2) extensive alteration of a facility such as to significantly change its function and purpose, even if such renovation does not include any structural change.

### Q22: What were the previously approved tranches of funding, and what major initiatives did they support?
**A22:** Previous tranches included the First Tranche (May 2021) with $580 million for 2021 CCRF and $15 million for TA/Business Coaches; Second Tranche (June 2021) with $500 million for SIR Child Care, $30 million for TRS Supports, $1.2 million for TRS Contracted Slots Pilot, and $3.45 million for Early Childhood Apprenticeship Pilot; Third Tranche (October 2021) with $2.45 billion for 2022 CCRF and $42.5 million for TWC Program/Admin Costs; and Fourth Tranche (November 2021) with $293.2 million for Low Income Child Care, $287 million for Provider Enrollment/Growth, $26 million for Pre-K Partnership Expansion, $25 million each for Matching Grant to Improve Quality and Shared Services Alliances, and other initiatives.

### Q7: What common stressors did families experience during the first two years of COVID-19 according to the survey?
**A7:** Very few families experienced none of the surveyed events. Nearly one-third of respondents lost a job or began a new job during this time, with only half of those who lost jobs indicating they began a new job. Nearly one-fifth experienced the death of a loved one. Nearly one-quarter indicated they are making less money now than before the pandemic. Families with a child with developmental delay or disability were more likely to experience loss of employment and had significantly more difficulty obtaining diapers or formula. Higher-income families were significantly more likely to report experiencing none of these events.

### Q11: How has COVID-19 impacted child behavior in early learning settings according to child care directors?
**A11:** Directors across all quality levels and education backgrounds reported seeing unprecedented increases in challenging behaviors. They described poor social-emotional skills, aggressive behaviors (throwing furniture, screaming, hitting), and difficulties with executive functioning (working in groups, changing tasks). Directors hypothesized this was due to children being kept at home and away from others longer than normal during COVID, increased screen time, and missing crucial developmental periods for socialization. Directors also reported increased numbers of children with potential developmental delays, particularly speech delays. These behavioral challenges were seen across all socioeconomic statuses and genders.

### Q20: What did parents identify as the most important needs for their children following the COVID-19 pandemic?
**A20:** Three major themes emerged from parent responses: (1) Social-emotional catch-up - parents described children rarely being around peers, struggling with potty training and learning to share, having difficulty socializing with friends, and being reluctant to express emotions or needs to adults; (2) Accommodations - families with children with delays or disabilities discussed needing inclusive child care for neurodiverse children, while others emphasized the need for caregivers who understand the world children are growing up in and can have grace for children trying to understand it; (3) Stability and consistency - expressed in terms of child care provider turnover disrupting children's progress, needing consistent routines, and wanting more stable general interactions. Many parents expressed frustration with provider turnover even when centers pay better than others in their area.

## early-childhood-system-needs-assessment-in-texas-final-accessible-part2-qa.md

### Q2: What quality control measures were implemented during the Family Survey data collection process?
**A2:** Out of 5,400 survey attempts, 1,314 respondents were automatically stopped from completing the survey due to inconsistency in their responses or because they progressed through the survey too quickly. Additionally, 2,089 respondents were analyzed for further anomalies, and 199 were excluded because of anomalies related to response patterns, such as services received not matching income to household size information.

### Q14: What training topics were included in the Early Childhood Workforce Survey for child care and Pre-K staff?
**A14:** Respondents were asked if they had completed continuing education or specialized training in: warm and responsive style, language facilitation and support, play-based interactions and guidance, support for children's self-regulation, instructional formats and approaches to learning, and scoring and interpreting developmental screeners. They indicated whether training occurred never, more than a year ago, or in the past year.

### Q17: What was the final sample size for the Early Childhood Workforce Survey?
**A17:** The sample included 60 child care workers and 86 early intervention workers. Of the childcare workforce, 47 were also a director or an owner of a home-based child care site. Of the early intervention workers, 23 were supervisors.

### Q18: What questions were asked about ECI providers' use of teletherapy?
**A18:** ECI providers were asked to rate their agreement with statements about whether therapies are more effective when provided in person, whether families prefer therapies provided in person, and whether therapists prefer to provide therapy in person. They were also asked what percentage of time they provided services by televisit in the past year, with response options ranging from 0-20% to 80-100%.

### Q19: What family-centered practices were assessed in the Early Childhood Workforce Survey?
**A19:** Respondents rated the extent to which they: suggested activities fitting family needs, offered positive feedback, established rapport, discussed expectations with other providers, told parents about additional services, accepted parents non-judgmentally, trusted parents as experts, discussed family feelings, answered questions completely, provided written information, treated parents as equals, helped parents feel like partners, promoted family-to-family connections, provided support to cope with impacts, and had information available about different concerns.

### Q20: What specific questions were asked of child care directors about developmental screening practices?
**A20:** Directors were asked if they conduct developmental screenings, what types of tools they use (such as ASQ, CDI, M-CHAT, curriculum-provided assessments, or self-developed assessments), who conducts the screenings (director, family support specialist, or teachers), and what type of training staff receive to administer and score the developmental screens (online training by publisher, third-party training, or training through local ECI provider).

### Q25: What was the final participation rate for the coalition surveys?
**A25:** Sixteen coalition leaders or contacts responded to the initial survey, and 136 coalition members responded to the member survey. This represents participation from a portion of the 42 identified coalitions.

### Q27: How did the coalition survey assess inter-organizational relationships?
**A27:** Coalition members were given a random sample of 15-20 other organizations in their coalition and asked to rate each organization's help with influence within the community, directly providing help to families, and providing resources for families. They also rated whether the organization's departure would mean activities wouldn't get done, whether the organization provides funding and material support central to the coalition, and whether the organization is a reliable partner.

### Q28: What structural characteristics of coalitions were assessed in the survey?
**A28:** Coalitions indicated whether: one agency provides administrative support, the leading organization changes on a timeline, there is a charter or by-laws, there is a strategic plan developed by the coalition, there is a mission statement, organizations not involved in core focus are invited to meetings, one organization leads execution while others advise, activities are performed by more than one organization, and the coalition has completed at least one community event in the past year.

### Q29: How did the coalition survey address family engagement and advisory structures?
**A29:** Coalitions were asked if they have a family advisory board or family representative, and if yes, whether family members are paid for their time, provided training about early childhood services, help design community outreach activities, are given specific time on meeting agendas to discuss emerging needs, and were involved in strategic planning or had major influence on coalition activities. Coalitions were also asked to describe how families were chosen.

### Q30: What questions were asked about coalition information-sharing practices related to family support?
**A30:** Coalition members rated the extent to which their coalition shares information that provides advice on how to connect parents to each other (through resource libraries, support groups, or the Internet), provides opportunities for the entire family to obtain information about early childhood issues, and provides advice on how to support or help families cope with the impact of their child's difficult behaviors (such as parenting programs, counseling, or direct support).

### Q31: What pandemic-related experiences were assessed in the Family Survey?
**A31:** Respondents were asked if they or anyone in their home experienced any of the following between March 2020 and the end of 2022: loss of employment, began a new job, lapse in child care for more than 1 month, needed to move due to housing affordability, death of family member or close friend, bought a home, went more than 1 day with little or no food, went through a divorce, had a child diagnosed with a developmental delay or disorder, had difficulty obtaining diapers/formula/baby care products, making less money than at the beginning, or had difficulty obtaining medical care or prescriptions.

### Q33: What specific child care arrangement questions were included in the Family Survey?
**A33:** Respondents indicated all types of child care help they have (from child care centers to relatives to informal arrangements), then selected the one they use most often. They rated satisfaction with location relative to work/school and home, quality, cost, hours of availability, ability to accommodate their schedule, and ability to accommodate their child's needs. They also provided their actual hours and days of child care use and their ideal hours if money and availability were not issues.

### Q38: What organizational climate questions were asked of direct care staff in the workforce survey?
**A38:** Direct care staff received 19 items adapted from the organizational health inventory used in schools, focusing on the role of the director in creating a positive work environment and the support between staff. Questions addressed whether the director explores all sides of topics, treats staff as equals, shows appreciation, discusses classroom issues, accepts questions, conducts meaningful evaluations, maintains performance standards, is friendly and approachable, and looks out for staff welfare, among other factors.

### Q39: What questions were asked about capacity to serve children with special needs?
**A39:** Child care directors were asked if their program reserves or prioritizes slots for children receiving ECI or ECSE services, if they reserve slots for children in foster care, if their facility has a quiet space for therapists to work with children, if they have served children with physical disabilities, and what factors have impacted their ability to serve children with physical disabilities (such as playground accessibility, staff support capabilities, or insurance requirements).

### Q40: How did director surveys assess trauma-informed care implementation?
**A40:** Directors rated the degree to which statements are true about their program (not at all true, somewhat true, mostly true, or completely true) regarding: hiring preference for candidates with trauma-informed care experience, ongoing training in trauma-specific evidence-based practices, support staff receiving ongoing training in integrating trauma-informed care principles, performance evaluations including trauma-informed care standards, and having a written process to regularly evaluate and monitor performance on trauma-informed care.

### Q4: What is the Texas Rising Star program and how has it grown?
**A4:** Texas Rising Star is a quality-based rating system for Texas early childhood programs participating in TWC's subsidized child care program. It offers three levels of certification (Two-Star, Three-Star, and Four-Star) to encourage child care programs to attain progressively higher certification requirements. Since 2017, the number of programs certified by Texas Rising Star has increased 139 percent. As of September 2024, 3,303 child care and early learning programs participated in Texas Rising Star, representing approximately 48.5 percent of all programs with agreements to accept subsidized children.

### Q6: How does TWC set provider reimbursement rates to encourage participation in quality programs?
**A6:** Beginning with FY 2024, TWC sets minimum threshold rates as follows: (1) Base rates are first set at the 75th percentile of the local market rate for each age group and type of care; (2) Rates are then compared to the Cost of Quality/Price Modeling Report, and if the CoQ price is higher, the rate is set to the higher amount; (3) Rates are compared to the previous year's rates, and if any rate would drop, the previous year's higher rate is maintained. Texas Rising Star enhanced reimbursement rates remain at least 5%, 7%, or 9% higher than base rates for Two-Star, Three-Star, and Four-Star certified providers, respectively.

### Q7: What is the Pre-K Partnership program and what progress has been made?
**A7:** Pre-K partnerships are collaborations between local education agencies (such as school districts or open-enrollment charter schools) and quality-rated child care programs to provide high-quality care and education to eligible three- and four-year-old children. Between June 2022 and June 2024, the TWC Pre-K Partnership department assisted with the development of 81 formal and 52 informal pre-K partnerships. Additionally, TWC awarded funds to 73 child care programs for a total of $2,250,000 disbursed for 63 pre-K-3 and 27 pre-K-4 partnership classrooms, with eligible programs receiving awards of up to $25,000 for each new pre-K partnership classroom.

### Q9: What professional development initiatives does TWC support for early childhood educators?
**A9:** TWC supports multiple professional development initiatives including: (1) Professional Development Scholarships through the T.E.A.C.H. program for CDA certificates, degrees, and apprenticeships; (2) Texas Rising Star Early Educator Conferences held three times annually; (3) Infant-Toddler Specialist Network serving 4,572 programs in FY 2024; (4) Staff retention programs focusing on director/owner leadership skills with 436 participants; (5) Planning for Individualized Instruction tools provided to 441 educators serving 2,400 children; (6) AgriLife Trainings with 115,837 participants accessing online courses; and (7) Registered Apprenticeship Programs supporting over 200 apprentices.

## stakeholder-input-trs-twc-qa.md

### Q2: What is Entry Level Designation (ELD) and how is it calculated?
**A2:** Entry Level Designation (ELD) is a status based on a provider's Child Care Regulation (CCR) compliance history. It's calculated using high-weighted deficiencies (scored at 5 points each) and medium-high deficiencies (scored at 3 points each). Providers are eligible for ELD if they do not exceed a 75-point threshold when these deficiencies are totaled.

## strand4_wkfc_concurrent_sessions_intro_acc-qa.md

### Q5: According to the Child Care Services Association's 2020 data, what is the primary reason early childhood educators leave the classroom?
**A5:** The primary reason educators leave the classroom is to make more money, cited by 41% of respondents. This is followed by professional growth opportunities (32%), better benefits (25%), and better working conditions (20%). This data highlights that compensation is the most significant factor driving turnover in the early childhood education workforce.

### Q6: What are the six concurrent session topics offered in Strand 4 of the workforce development program?
**A6:** The six concurrent session topics are: (1) Workforce Qualifications, Certificates and Credentials; (2) Access to Education and Training; (3) PD Career Pathways and Registries; (4) Recruitment, Retention and Turnover; (5) Targeted Coaching and Mentoring Systems; and (6) Compensation Strategies. These sessions provide focused discussions on critical workforce issues in early childhood education.

### Q7: How has the approach to training and professional development evolved in early childhood education?
**A7:** The approach has evolved to include increased reliance on online learning, rethinking traditional topics in new ways (such as trauma-informed care, culturally responsive care, family partnerships, and business administration), and significant expansion of coaching and mentoring.

### Q1: What is the vision of the Texas Early Learning Strategic Plan 2024-2026?
**A1:** The vision is that "All young Texans have a strong foundation for success." This vision focuses on ensuring children in Texas are physically, mentally, emotionally, and socially ready to transition to kindergarten and beyond by holistically supporting the adults, communities, and entities who serve young children. The plan emphasizes building this foundation through supportive parents/caregivers, accessible early learning services, a well-paid and trained workforce, strong local collaborations, and data-informed state coordination.

### Q2: How many main goals does the strategic plan include and what are they?
**A2:** The plan includes four main goals organized into strategic areas: (1) Family Navigation, Access & Engagement - ensuring families can easily meet their basic needs and access early learning services while providing meaningful feedback; (2) Workforce Recruitment, Retention & Support - creating a well-paid, trained, and supported early learning workforce; (3) Local Systems & Partnership Building - developing well-coordinated local early learning systems; and (4) Data & System Coordination - promoting collaboration among state entities to make family- and data-informed decisions to improve services.

### Q4: What are the three categories used to classify the plan's actions, and what do they mean?
**A4:** The plan categorizes actions into three types to indicate their current progress: (1) Continue - actions that refine, expand, or proceed with work already in progress; (2) Create - actions that require developing something new that has yet to be created; and (3) Explore - actions that are preliminary in nature or process-oriented that will lead to future strategies and actions. This classification helps stakeholders understand where each initiative stands in the implementation timeline.

### Q5: How does the strategic plan address streamlining family access to early learning programs?
**A5:** The plan includes multiple strategies to streamline family access, including: launching a common eligibility screener on earlychildhood.texas.gov for TEA, THSSCO, and TWC programs; developing a mechanism to notify families of their eligibility for other services; exploring ways to reduce redundancy in program applications; expanding Help Me Grow Texas and Healthy Child Care Texas for cross-sector developmental screenings; and utilizing the Early Childhood Integrated Data System (ECIDS) to identify overlap and gaps among families served by early learning programs.

### Q6: What workforce support initiatives are included in the plan to improve recruitment and retention?
**A6:** The plan addresses workforce support through several initiatives: continuing scholarships and Registered Apprenticeships to cover CDA, associates, and bachelor's credentials (750 scholarships in FFY 2024-2026); providing recruitment and retention stipends for 800 HHSC ECI therapists; offering child care business training about evidence-based staff retention strategies to 210 providers; expanding access to teacher-child interaction assessment and coaching models (100 teachers by 2026); creating peer-to-peer mentoring opportunities; and developing messaging that elevates the importance of early learning workers as vital to the Texas economy.

### Q7: What is the Early Childhood Integrated Data System (ECIDS) and what are its goals?
**A7:** ECIDS is a data system being developed to strengthen data sharing across agencies and better inform state-level policy and program improvement. By the end of 2026, ECIDS aims to answer foundational questions around eligibility, access, and enrollment in early learning services and programs in Texas. The plan includes creating a cross-agency data governance plan, developing required data sharing agreements, designing a data dashboard for communities with usage instructions, and building business cases to identify overlap and gaps among families served by all early learning programs.

### Q8: How will the strategic plan support local communities and partnerships?
**A8:** The plan supports local communities through several mechanisms: DFPS/HHSC will continue offering sub-grants to existing PEI local programs to hire full-time staff for coalition work and focus on community needs ($5.5 million across 29 communities); TWC and TEA will continue supporting pre-kindergarten and child care partnerships (300 partnerships by 2026); TELC will expand the Prevention and Early Intervention Community Toolkit to include best practices, guidance on public/private partnerships, funding strategies, governance and leadership resources; and a centralized list of community collaborations and coalitions will be created and published.

### Q9: What role does family feedback play in the strategic plan, and how will it be collected?
**A9:** Family feedback is central to the plan's success. The plan emphasizes that when parents believe their child care providers are partners in their child's wellbeing, they rate their own family's quality of life and resiliency higher. Strategies include: LEAs creating and posting Prekindergarten Family Engagement Plans on district web pages; DFPS/HHSC partnering with local coalitions to collect family feedback; ECIW and TELC creating more opportunities for families to provide feedback on early learning system services; publishing family feedback and related service improvements through early learning communications channels; and conducting regular family engagement activities with results published on earlylearningtexas.org.

### Q2: Does the calculator save my data, and do I need to create an account to use it?
**A2:** No, users do not need to log in to use the Texas PCQC, and the calculator does not save or store any data entered by users. If you navigate away from the results page without printing or saving as a PDF, all information will be lost and must be re-entered from the beginning. Users should print or save their results using the "Print/Save PDF" button on the results page before starting a new scenario.

### Q3: How does the calculator handle mandatory benefits and taxes for employees?
**A3:** The Texas PCQC automatically calculates average mandatory training costs as well as state and federal mandatory benefits based on the number of personnel you have. This includes State Unemployment Tax at 2.7%, Social Security and Medicare at 7.65%, and Federal Unemployment Tax at 6%. This information is sourced from the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act and the Internal Revenue Service for Social Security and Medicare Withholding rates.

### Q4: What information do I need to have ready before using the calculator?
**A4:** You'll need basic information about your child care center including: county location, Texas Rising Star participation level, daily hours of operation (for under 5 and school-age children), number of children in each age group (0-11 months through school age), total number of classrooms, student-to-teacher ratios, and desired maximum group sizes. You'll also need information about personnel costs, benefits offered, occupancy costs (rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance), operational costs, and revenue including tuition rates and subsidy information.

### Q5: How do I adjust staff compensation in the calculator?
**A5:** The calculator provides two methods to increase staff compensation above regional averages. You can either increase by percentage (using a slider bar to select the desired percentage over regional average) OR by entering a specific annual dollar amount increase. Important: The calculator will NOT calculate both methods simultaneously - you must choose one. Any compensation increases you enter will impact ALL staff positions at the child care center.

### Q6: What is breakeven tuition and how is it calculated?
**A6:** Breakeven tuition is the monthly tuition amount automatically populated by the calculator that you would need to charge per child to cover all your costs without any profit. This calculation does not account for other forms of revenue like subsidized tuition, CACFP food reimbursements, or other revenue sources. The breakeven tuition shown in Step 4: Revenue is not adjusted for subsidies selected - those adjustments appear in the final results page.

### Q7: How does the calculator handle Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) subsidies?
**A7:** If you opt into the CACFP, the calculator treats food program subsidies as a pass-through cost savings to parents/guardians rather than revenue to the center. You'll enter the percentage of students in three income brackets: those receiving free meals (family income less than 130% FPL), price-reduced meals (130-185% FPL), and lower-rate subsidies (greater than 185% FPL). The results show a "Food Program Subsidy Tuition Adjustment" that subtracts food reimbursements from total tuition revenue, which has a net zero impact on total revenue.

### Q8: Why can't I mix school-age children with younger age groups in the same classroom?
**A8:** Children six years and older are often enrolled in after-school programs with different hours of operation and staffing arrangements than programs for younger children. Keeping school-age children in separate classrooms ensures the calculator yields the most accurate results based on the distinct operational requirements, such as different daily hours during the school year (August through May) versus summer months (June through July).

### Q10: Where does the default data in the calculator come from?
**A10:** Default salary and hourly wage data primarily comes from the Texas Labor Market Information website under Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS). Default non-personnel expense data comes from the Center for American Progress's True Cost of Child Care project for Texas and the Administration on Children and Families' Provider Cost of Quality Calculator. Benefits data comes from the Texas Workforce Commission and Texas Health and Human Services websites. Default staff salaries and wages are adjusted based on your selected county location and Texas Rising Star program participation level.

The initiative emphasizes collaboration with HHSC's ECI program to ensure seamless transitions and coordinated supports, while also investing in specialized equipment and environmental modifications that enable full participation of children with diverse abilities in early learning settings.

### Q9: What professional development opportunities are available through this grant?
**A9:** The grant offers a comprehensive professional development system including online learning platforms with stackable credentials and micro-credentials, in-person training through regional Education Service Centers and workforce development boards, coaching and mentoring programs that provide on-site support to educators, specialized training on topics such as trauma-informed care, social-emotional development, and culturally responsive practices, and leadership development programs for program directors and administrators. All professional development is aligned with the Texas Early Learning Guidelines and Texas Rising Star quality standards to ensure consistency and relevance.

### Q10: What sustainability plans are in place to continue PDG B-5 initiatives after federal funding ends?
**A10:** Texas has developed a multi-faceted sustainability strategy that includes integrating successful PDG initiatives into existing state-funded programs and services, leveraging braided funding from CCDF, state general revenue, and private partnerships, building local capacity through train-the-trainer models and community-based infrastructure, advocating for continued legislative support and appropriations for early childhood priorities, and documenting outcomes and return on investment to demonstrate the value of continued investment. The state is also exploring public-private partnerships and employer engagement strategies to diversify funding sources and create long-term support for the early childhood system.
