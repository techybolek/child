# Parent TX3C Attendance Help - Q&A

## Getting Started & Account Setup

**Q1: How do I create my KinderConnect online account to track my child's attendance?**

A1: To create your KinderConnect account, go to https://childcare.twc.texas.gov/KinderConnect and follow the registration instructions. If you're unable to create an account, contact KinderConnect support at 1-888-265-6461 or supportTX@kindersystems.com.

**Q2: What are the different systems I need to know about for the TX3C attendance process?**

A2: There are three main systems: KinderConnect (the parent online account website for viewing attendance), KinderSign (the tablet at the child care center for daily sign-in/out), and KinderSmart (the mobile app for reporting absences). Each serves a specific purpose in tracking your child's attendance.

## Daily Sign-In and Sign-Out

**Q3: How do I record my child's daily arrival and departure at the child care center?**

A3: Use the tablet (KinderSign) located at your child care provider's facility. Enter your phone number, and if it's your first time using the system, create a PIN. You'll need to do this each day when you drop off and pick up your child.

**Q4: What happens if the tablet at the center is offline when I try to sign in or out?**

A4: You should sign in or out as usual even if the tablet is offline. The system will automatically update and sync the attendance records when the tablet reconnects to the internet, so your attendance will still be recorded.

**Q5: Can I go back and record attendance for days I missed signing in or out?**

A5: Yes, you can record attendance from past days using the tablet at the center, but only for the past 6 days. Any attendance older than 6 days cannot be entered retroactively.

## Attendance Corrections and Issues

**Q6: What should I do if there's a wrong day or time recorded in the attendance system?**

A6: Speak directly to your child care provider about any incorrect dates or times. They have the ability to correct attendance records in the system.

**Q7: If KinderConnect shows that my child's attendance is wrong or incomplete, what do I need to do?**

A7: You only need ONE sign-in OR sign-out time per day for attendance to be valid. If the system shows attendance is wrong, check if you're missing either the sign-in or sign-out, and just add the missing one. You don't need to re-record the entire day.

## Reporting Absences

**Q8: How do I report that my child will be absent when they're sick or away from the center?**

A8: Download the KinderSmart app on your phone, then scan the QR code from your KinderConnect account (website) to register the app. Once registered, you can use the app to notify the center when your child won't be there.

**Q9: I'm having trouble registering the KinderSmart app - what should I do?**

A9: Log into your KinderConnect account on the website to find the QR code needed for app registration. If you still can't register the app, contact KinderConnect support for assistance.

## Getting Help and Support

**Q10: What are my options if I need help with the attendance system or have questions?**

A10: You have two main support options: (1) Contact KinderConnect Support Monday through Friday, 6 AM to 9 PM Central Time by calling 1-888-265-6461, emailing supportTX@kindersystems.com, or visiting http://tx3c.info/ for online help, or (2) Ask your child care provider directly, as they can help with most sign-in/out and attendance-related questions.
