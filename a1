We have multiple chunks. Need to consider that the question refers to maximum income for family of 5, with bi-weekly income. So we need to find information about income thresholds, likely maximum eligibility limit, for family size 5. Possibly in some chunk there is table of thresholds. Let\'s examine chunks:\n\nChunk 0: general description of calculating family income, not specific numbers. Score maybe low (2).\n\nChunk 1: calculation of average base monthly earned income from pay stubs. Contains formulas for weekly, biweekly. This is directly relevant because we need to compute maximum income from bi-weekly. But question asks maximum income, not formula. But still relevant. Score maybe 5.\n\nChunk 2: mentions reviewing previous 3 months of income. Not specific thresholds. Low relevance (2).\n\nChunk 3: Contains table of Gross Monthly Income thresholds for Family Size 1, 2, etc. It includes numbers for 1,2, etc but we need for size 5. Not included but maybe earlier part omitted. This chunk includes threshold for family sizes 1 to 2 only. So not fully relevant. Score maybe 3.\n\nChunk 4: about irregular fluctuations. Not relevant. Score 1.\n\nChunk 5: about determining if Monthly Family Income Exceeds 85% of SMI. Might mention threshold but not numbers. Low relevance. Score 2.\n\nChunk 6: about self-employment hours. Not relevant. Score 1.\n\nChunk 7: about local variation table. Not specific thresholds. Score 2.\n\nChunk 8: Contains many numbers maybe thresholds for different family sizes? Let\'s analyze chunk 8: It lists numbers for 7, 8, 9, 10 etc. But the lines: "7 $45,420 $68,130 $79,485 $84,027 ..." Could be incomes for some region. Not clear. Might be for something else. Not very relevant. Score 1.\n\nChunk 9: Contains Family Size table. "Family Size 3, 4, 5" etc. But includes 100% of SMI and Maximum Initial Eligibility Limit (or Threshold) $ etc. But it\'s for 3, 4, 5. Contains values: For 5: 9977.00 85% 8481.00. That\'s the maximum initial eligibility limit? Actually 85% of SMI is threshold. So for family size 5, threshold 85% SMI is $8481.00 per month. The question: "maximum income to remain eligible for the program?" Might refer to threshold maybe 100%? Wait maximum initial eligibility limit maybe 100% of SMI? The table shows 100% of SMI $9977.00. So maximum initial eligibility limit maybe $8481.00? Actually 85% threshold. The question might want maximum income to remain eligible. That would be 85% SMI? The phrase "maximum income to remain eligible" could be the threshold at which they become ineligible. That would be 85% of SMI? The table shows threshold at 85% SMI. So threshold for family 5 is $8481.00 per month. But we need bi-weekly? So we need to convert monthly to bi-weekly. That would be $8481/2.165 = about $3918. But the question says "bi-weekly" and asks maximum income to remain eligible. So we need to provide maximum bi-weekly income. But we just need to answer based on chunk content. The relevant chunk is chunk 9. Score maybe 8.\n\nChunk 10: more numbers maybe part of some table but not relevant. Score 2.\n\nChunk 11: more numbers. Not relevant.

Doc 1 provides table: For family size 5: 100% SMI $9,977; 85% SMI $8,481. So maximum initial eligibility limit is $8,481. But the question: "If a family of 5 earns income bi-weekly, what is their maximum income to remain eligible for the program?" They also mention bi-weekly income. We might need to convert to monthly? But maximum income is the monthly amount. However, maybe they want the maximum average monthly income based on bi-weekly earnings. The income calculation: The rule says average monthly earnings = pay period earnings * 2.167 (biweekly). But they ask "maximum income to remain eligible". Likely the monthly income limit. The 85% SMI limit is $8,481 monthly. That is the maximum monthly gross income to remain eligible. Provide citation [Doc 1]. Also mention the calculation for biweekly: average monthly = biweekly pay * 2.167. But the maximum monthly income is $8,481. Provide steps? No. Just answer.\n\nThus answer: maximum monthly average earnings: $8,481. If biweekly pay, that means the biweekly earnings should be $8,481 / 2.167 = about $3,907. But better to say the monthly limit is $8,481, so biweekly pay should be no more than ~$3,907. Let\'s compute: 8481 / 2.167 = about 3913? Let\'s calculate: 8481 / 2 = 4240.5; /0.167? Actually 8481 / 2.167 = 3915 approx. Let\'s compute: 2.167 * 4000 = 8668; difference -187; 2.167* 3500 = 7584.5; 2.167* 3950 = 8552.65. So around 3900. Let\'s do precise: 8481 / 2.167 = 3915.6. So about $3,916 biweekly.\n\nWe can mention that.\n\nAnswer: maximum average monthly income $8,481. Biweekly earnings should be no more than about $3,916 per pay period. Cite [Doc 1].

QUESTION:
If a family of 5 earns income bi-weekly, what is their maximum income to remain eligible for the program?

EXPECTED ANSWER:
A family of 5 with bi-weekly income must earn no more than $4,106 per pay period to remain eligible for the program in Board Contract Year 2026. This corresponds to an annual income limit of $106,768.

CHATBOT ANSWER:
**Maximum income to stay eligible (family of 5)**  

| Income source | Limit for 5‑person family (85 % SMI) |
|---|---|
| **Average monthly gross income** | **$8,481** per month  [Doc 1] |

If the family is paid **bi‑weekly**, the average monthly income is calculated by multiplying the bi‑weekly pay by 2.167 (the conversion factor for bi‑weekly pay periods).  
To keep the average monthly income at or below $8,481, the bi‑weekly earnings must be no more than:

\[
\frac{8,481}{2.167}\;\approx\;\$3,916 \text{ per bi‑weekly pay period}
\]

So, a family of five earning bi‑weekly can receive a maximum of about **$3,916 each pay period** (equivalent to **$8,481 per month**) to remain eligible for the Texas childcare assistance program.
