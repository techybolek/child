We need relevance score 0-10 per chunk. Let\'s assess each chunk:\n\nChunk0: D-107 about calculating family income, guidelines. Some relevance but generic. Score maybe 4.\n\nChunk1: Child Care Services Guide, calculating average base monthly earned income from pay stubs, includes bi-weekly calculation. Relevant for converting bi-weekly to monthly but not threshold. Score 6 maybe.\n\nChunk2: about reviewing previous three months of income. Generic.

Not directly family size but includes 3-? Actually table shows 3,4,5 families? Let\'s read chunk3: It\'s a table with "Family Size" and columns: 100% FPG, 150% FPG, etc. For 3: $1,215 etc. So includes thresholds for family size 3, but not 5. So somewhat relevant.

Actually maybe months? Hard. It shows incomes like 45,420 etc. Could be household income thresholds for family size? Let\'s interpret: Looks like for different families? Actually "8" maybe family size? Not sure. But it\'s likely the "maximum income limits" table for CCDF. Let\'s inspect chunk8: starts with 7 $45,420 etc. The numbers are large, likely annual. So could be maximum annual incomes for family sizes 7? Wait family size 7 would be huge. So maybe this table shows "Maximum Initial Eligibility Limit" for each region? Not clear. But still relevant maybe. Score 4.\n\nChunk9: shows family size 3,4,5 with numbers like 7225, 8601 etc. This is monthly? This is 100% SMI threshold for 3,4,5 families. It includes threshold values, not max eligibility. But question asks maximum income to remain eligible. That threshold likely 85% SMI or 100% SMI? The program might have threshold at 85% SMI. But the table gives 100% SMI monthly amounts. So maybe relevant. Score 5.\n\nChunk10: weird numbers maybe allowances. Not relevant. Score 1.\n\nChunk11: more numbers maybe allowances. Not relevant. Score 1.\n\nChunk12: link to income eligibility limits. Some relevance. Score 3.\n\nChunk13: PSoC table with monthly income for family size 4. Not relevant. Score 1.\n\nChunk14: about policy.

The question likely refers to Texas child care assistance program, which uses maximum initial eligibility limits based on percentages of SMI (State Median Income). The documents provide tables: Doc 2 shows gross monthly income for various family sizes at different percent levels (100% FPG, 150% FPG, etc.) and also SMI percentages (55% SMI, 75% SMI, 80% SMI, 85% SMI). Doc 3 provides for family size 3,4,5 the "Maximum Initial Eligibility Limit (or Threshold)" of 85% SMI in dollars. For size 5, from Doc 3: we see family size 5: 100% SMI $? The table: lines: "Family Size 5: 100% of SMI ($/Month) 5 9977.00 85.00 8481.00". But doc 3 seems truncated? Let\'s parse Doc 3. It lists for size 3, 4, 5:\n\n- Family Size 3: 100% of SMI ($/Month) 7225.00 ; Maximum Initial Eligibility Limit (or Threshold) % 85.00 ; Maximum Initial Eligibility Limit $ 6141.00\n- Family Size 4: 100% of SMI $8601.00 ; Max Initial Eligibility Limit % 85.00 ; Max Initial Eligibility Limit $ 7311.00\n- Family Size 5: 100% of SMI $9977.00 ; Max Initial Eligibility Limit % 85.00 ; Max Initial Eligibility Limit $ 8481.00\n\nThus maximum eligibility limit for a family of 5 is $8,481 per month. That is the maximum monthly income to remain eligible. However, the question asks: "If a family of 5 earns income bi-weekly, what is their maximum income to remain eligible for the program?" Since the family earns bi-weekly, we need to convert monthly limit to bi-weekly earnings? They might ask for monthly or bi-weekly maximum. The maximum monthly income is $8,481. To compute bi-weekly maximum, we use the calculation from Doc 1: For biweekly, multiply average earnings per pay period by 2.165 or 2.167. But the question likely expects monthly income limit. It says "If a family of 5 earns income bi-weekly, what is their maximum income to remain eligible for the program?" Might require to compute the maximum bi-weekly income that corresponds to $8,481 monthly. Since monthly is average monthly, we can divide by 2.165 (average earnings per pay period times 2.165). That would give about $3,921. But maybe we need to calculate maximum per bi-weekly pay period: average earnings per pay period = monthly income / 2.165. So average earnings per pay period = 8481 / 2.165 = about 3,919. Let\'s compute precisely: 8481 / 2.165 = 3,916.5. Alternatively, if using 2.167: 8481 / 2.167 = 3,914.3. So around $3,915 per bi-weekly pay period.\n\nBut the question: "what is their maximum income to remain eligible for the program?" The answer likely: The maximum average monthly income is $8,481. To stay below that, bi-weekly income should average around $3,915 per pay period. Let\'s cite Doc 3 for the $8,481 figure, and Doc 1 for the calculation method. Also cite Doc 2 for SMI percentages. But the precise maximum is from Doc 3. So answer: $8,481 monthly, or about $3,915 bi-weekly.

QUESTION:
If a family of 5 earns income bi-weekly, what is their maximum income to remain eligible for the program?

EXPECTED ANSWER:
A family of 5 with bi-weekly income must earn no more than $4,106 per pay period to remain eligible for the program in Board Contract Year 2026. This corresponds to an annual income limit of $106,768.

CHATBOT ANSWER:
**Maximum income for a family of five**

| Income type | Maximum amount | How it’s calculated | Source |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Average gross monthly income** | **$8,481** | The “Maximum Initial Eligibility Limit (or Threshold)” for a 5‑member family at 85 % of the State Median Income (SMI). | [Doc 3] |
| **Average gross bi‑weekly income** | **≈ $3,915** | Monthly limit ÷ 2.165 (or 2.167) to convert to an average bi‑weekly pay period. | [Doc 1] |

**Explanation**

- Texas child‑care assistance uses the 85 % SMI threshold for income eligibility.  
- For a family of five, the 85 % SMI limit is $8,481 per month【Doc 3】.  
- If the family is paid bi‑weekly, the average gross earnings per pay period must not exceed the monthly limit divided by 2.165 (the standard conversion factor for bi‑weekly pay).  $8,481 ÷ 2.165 ≈ $3,915 per bi‑weekly pay period【Doc 1】.  

Thus, to remain eligible, a five‑member family earning bi‑weekly should keep their average bi‑weekly earnings at or below roughly **$3,915** (which equals an average monthly income of **$8,481**).
